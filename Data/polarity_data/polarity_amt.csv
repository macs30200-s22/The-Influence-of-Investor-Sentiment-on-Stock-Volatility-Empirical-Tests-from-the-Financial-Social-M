CoreSite Implements Modern, Energy-Efficient Cooling System in Its Boston Data Center 
  
CoreSite, a leading hybrid IT solutions provider and subsidiary of American Tower Corporation (NYSE: AMT) (‚ÄúAmerican Tower‚Äù), announced it will now serve customers in its Boston data center facility with a highly energy-efficient cooling system that will save an estimated eight million kilowatt-hours each year. The equipment upgrade is part of the company‚Äôs ongoing commitment to deploy efficient power and cooling best practices throughout its portfolio of data centers. CoreSite‚Äôs Boston data center, or BO1, which borders Cambridge and Boston‚Äôs central business district, has a new chiller plant consisting of three chillers with magnetically levitated centrifugal compressors where each lineup  (...)

280,445922012,"$ASTS $T $VOD $AMT You can currently invest in ASTS now for less than what AT&amp;T, Vodaphone, American Tower and Rakuten all did in April 2021. They paid the IPO price of $10 per share.  However this opportunity to buy ASTS at around the IPO price is fleeting because ASTS&#39;s Bluewalker3 test satellite is basically ready for launch and SpaceX will be launching it in the summer of 2022 which is only months away.  
 
I predict that this week could be the last time ASTS stock trades at or near the IPO price. Analysts are expecting it to triple in less than 6 months to over $30. 
 
The stock is heavily shorted which makes absolutely no sense to me as AT&amp;T, Vodaphone, American Tower and Rakuten all strongly believe in the technology and  investment opportunity.

Entrepreneurs can see ahead in the future, and find and create business opportunities. Investors that can see the vision of these entrepreneurs and invest in their companies always become wealthy. This is nothing new. Is ASTS one of these companies that will create vast wealth? 
So ask yourself this is cell connectivity from space going to be a thing? Is it cheaper and more effective then cell towers on earth, and can space satellites offer connectivity to anyone anywhere?

This seems like a üêíüçåüß† special. 

I like SBA most, only because market cap is lower ($35 B for SBA, $77 billion for CCI, $108 billion for AMT).

Imagine a digital asset that gives you partial ownership to real life properties. Revenue from the managed properties are distributed to NFT holders. Token holders get airdrops and access to the NFTs. The token just launched last week without a hitch, so it&#39;s still super early to get in. Plus in general, we&#39;re at such an early stage at dawn of this new type of investing, so sky is the limit long-term imho.

Maybe because ASTS has superior technology and they want to defend themselves from competitors coming in that could compete and over take them. ASTS is a very big business threat to Hughes and they are trying to dissuade the FCC to grant permits to ASTS. This just shows me that&#39;s another reason to buy ASTS. Another big company believes that ASTS is the real deal.  Bears who have shorted should be very careful this week. With 23% of the float short and ASTS trending higher, it&#39;s a recipe for a huge move upwards. Shorts could be in big trouble if people pile in. 
 
I have a feeling that with AT&amp;T&#39;s recent 9 billion dollar purchase of spectrum from the US Government will certainly help ASTS since AT&amp;T has invested in ASTS and plans to partner with ASTS.  Hopefully AT&amp;T will vehemently counter lobby the FCC in favour of ASTS. I don&#39;t think AT&amp;T would go into a 9 billion cap expenditure blind.
