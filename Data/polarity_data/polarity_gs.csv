50,448237490," Barclays ($BCS) shares in London early trading saw a drop of ~4% after one of its top investors offloaded a $1.2B block of stock at a discount overnight. 
 
As per Refinitiv Eikon data cited by Reuters an unnamed investor sold 599M shares equivalent of 3.6% stake last evening; transaction facilitated by Goldman Sachs. 
 
Goldman Sachs note cited by Reuters states: The institutional seller has instructed Goldman Sachs to sell 575M shares in Barclays through a public bookbuild process. 
 
This news comes on the heels of the bank disclosing a $592M loss on botched structured product sales yesterday. 
Also, Eikon data indicates that Capital Group offloaded 399M shares on Monday but it remains unclear whether the sale was connected to the transaction managed by Goldman Sachs.

From Feb. 17 through March 14, there wasn&#39;t one traditional initial public offering in the U.S., the longest dry spell not resulting from a holiday season, Dealogic said. On Tuesday, March 15, small medical cannabis suppler Akanda (AKAN) raised $16M in an IPO. Still, bankers aren&#39;t expecting an IPO resurgence for some time. 
 
Follow-on share sales and convertible bond offerings have also slowed significantly. The reduced new shares being offered are poised to reduce Q1 2022 revenue after last year&#39;s boom.

Starting with the Treaty of Aigun in 1858 and the Treaty of Peking in 1860, the Sino‚ÄìRussian border was realigned in Russia&#39;s favor along the Amur and Ussuri rivers.

Goldman criticized over $150M loan to Peabody Energy, FT reports 
 
After winning support from environmentalists in 2019 for its pledge to curb fossil fuel financing, Goldman Sachs (GS) is under fire for a $150M loan to Peabody Energy (BTU), the largest private sector coal producer, Patrick Temple-West of The Financial Times reports. The deal, which was made last week, highlighted the ambiguity in Goldman Sachs&#39; pledge, for in 2019 the bank said it would only support companies shifting away from coal at a reasonable pace. The deal was made to aid Peabody&#39;s derivatives amid the market turbulence caused by Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine.",2022-03-14T12:35:57Z,NONE,0.3846153550295881

Unlike over-the-counter CME Group bitcoin products, which it began trading last year, Goldman takes on more risk with over-the-counter products. 
 
Goldman Sachs is one of the largest players in the traditional asset market, so its entry into over-the-counter cryptocurrency clearly indicates the maturity of this asset class. This can also be an important signal to other institutional investors, such as hedge funds. 
 
This commercial transaction is the first time a bank has allowed its customers to gain direct exposure to cryptocurrencies. 
 
For the time being, hedge funds are seeking to sell bitcoin derivatives, that is, to bet on exchange rate changes without taking virtual money directly into their possession. This market is dominated by inherently cryptic companies such as Galaxy, Genesis and GSR Market.

Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) stock is climbing 6.0% in Frankfurt and jumping 9.3% in U.S. premarket trading after reports that Germany&#39;s largest lender is &quot;winding down&quot; its business in Russia. 
 
The about-face came after Wall Street titans JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) and Goldman Sachs ($GS) both said they&#39;re shuttering operations in Russia in light of the country&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. 
 
Just a couple days earlier, the bank said it wouldn&#39;t pull out of the Russian market, noting that its credit exposures to Russia and Ukraine were a &quot;very small portion of the bank&#39;s overall loan portfolio.&quot; 
On Friday, Deutsche Bank (DB) also said it agreed to keep in place until February 2023 a monitor to track is ESG claims at its DWS subsidiary after the U.S. Department of Justice found the bank had violated a deferred prosecution agreement.

See Consumer credit card report yest.?

Was it him?

HEY, a c.c. spend # takes time for likes of $JPM &amp; $GS to digest, not a CPI # simplicity.

Consumers, on paper, spent....less December, est. $22B vs actual $18.6B, but, did they?

Sure. W.H.O. &amp; CDC, in LATE NOV., were both stressing staying home, as, Black Friday 1st announcement of Omicron was Nov. 24 pre-Thanksgiving Day, Wed.
Convenient, really, as millions of USA shoppers were to shop.
Many stayed home.
1) Omicron &quot;is deadly.&quot; 
2) Omi 42x more contagious than Delta

And, Biden said Dec. 7, &quot;Stay home if not vaxed.&quot;
So many did, still how MUCH DID consumers SPEND Dec.? 18.6Büò±

As been saying, I&#39;ll probably trade it at least 100 times this year -- same as 2019, 2020 and close to that in 2021... great trading stock as can go in and out of big allocations (as high as 75k twice for me) without impaling myself due to big float and only one penny spreads.

@MOMO51214  
imo The market generally and big cap financials with them are being reset before the surge to new highs this year for everything, incl, along with the crap of the market composition, quality big cap financials and tech.  
 
Unfortunately, this reset has created lots of dislocation. Drivers:(1)Fed put is gone and is now going to be Fed the inflation fighter with aggressive policy that hopefully does not crash the economy into recession (note policy actions will push rates higher and soon be great for big cap financials imo), (2) Russian actions create FUD about everything, (3) energy was going ape before russia&#39;s bs and is now going to bubbleland, (4) Robinhood fanboys lost their capital from last year&#39;s stimulus checks &amp; dipshit chasing Kathy ideas are now back to playing video games in mommy&#39;s basement, and more.

Historically, GS has been the brilliant star in the group; the group has generally traded with a relative (to the SP 500) P/E ratio of 60-80%. Given the present market multiple is say 20, that renders a low end of the band relative level of say 12x for GS... again, GS is presently trading at 6x??? A fatty pitch to be sure imo. Note it is by far the cheapest of the premier big cap financials. 
 
I&#39;ll hazaed a guess they raise the dividend further, and do a lot more buybacks than the recent run rate of $1B/Q... otherwise, there are a lot of GS bankers that are not going to be happy with their &quot;incentive&quot; of getting more options this stock temporarily hosed down.",2022-03-08T15:59:21Z,NONE,0.11111109876543349

Bullard&#39;s trial balloon as to 50 bps in March went over like a big turd in the punchbowl.  The last thing the Fed wants to do is topple the applecart, so this is a non-starter it seems. 
 
Past that, if the Fed were to raise  on policy rates by 50 bps in March, that would be extremely bullish for the big cap banks with high interest rate sensitivity... BAC would benefit more than any other big cap bank, but most all would benefit, and certainly so would FAS once the legit pm take their heads out of the ground. So what do the algo fheads do?  Turn on the sell program for everything.

Peabody Energy ($BTU) recently raised debt from Goldman Sachs ($GS) at 10% to finance derivative margin calls; the company plans to sell coal in coming months, they used derivatives to lock in a price, and as the market went higher, the derivatives required Peabody (BTU) to post collateral -- shares fell 10%+ when the margin call was announced, and the dynamic is now well understood by the market.

Anybody watching Buffett right now?

Age crushed him. He sounds terrible. His brain is definitely not what it was years ago. 

I don&#39;t know how much longer I can watch him stutter and struggle on stage. 

My thoughts on Buffett were always conflicted. Was/is he a brilliant financial mind? Absolutely. 

However, huge asterisk next to his accomplishments. He&#39;s been very politically connected for years and years. He got deals nobody else was offered (with $OXY $GS ). So that definitely makes him look more impressive than he actually is. 

Great accountant, but political connections were a significant tailwind in his success. And he&#39;s often FOS.

Let‚Äôs counter the $GS 
bull with positivity..

The best time to buy any cyclical business is when things aren&#39;t going well. Sure, oil investors were probably scared in late 2020 when oil was less than $20 per barrel and shares of ExxonMobil traded at $34. However, they will likely have better long-term returns than someone who recently bought at $80 after oil rebounded to more than $100.

I think the same logic can apply to Robinhood; the stock is down more than 80% from its highest price. Yes, the engagement numbers are getting worse. Still, if you believe that Robinhood is here to stay, then it makes sense to expect these numbers to improve as the markets recover and retail investors return to their investment accounts. But by then, Robinhood&#39;s stock may be valued higher than it is today. In other words, the sky is falling at Robinhood, which might make it a good time to consider buying shares.",2022-04-08T11:27:19Z,Bullish,0.5999999700000015
