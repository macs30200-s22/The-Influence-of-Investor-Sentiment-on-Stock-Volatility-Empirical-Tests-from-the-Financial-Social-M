&quot;I do want to set clear expectations: Not everyone who lives within range of our drones will be able to order on Day 1,&quot; Wing CEO Adam Woodworth declared. &quot;We&#39;re going to invite customers in groups to make sure everyone has a good first experience with drone delivery.&quot; Eventually, Wing hopes to expand the service to all the tens of thousands of homes in Frisco and Little Elm, and then to other regions in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area. 
 
Go deeper: Wing has been testing its service in the Dallas suburbs since last year following experiments in Christiansburg, Virginia; Helsinki, Finland; and Canberra and Logan, Australia (it just made its 200,000th delivery).

224,450779789," The first commercial drone deliveries in the U.S. will take off on Thursday as Alphabet&#39;s ($GOOG) ($GOOGL) Wing unleashes its aircraft over the suburban towns of Frisco and Little Elm, just north of Dallas, Texas. If successful, the service could revolutionize how goods are currently transported around cities. Wing has partnered with Walgreens (NASDAQ:$WBA), Blue Bell Creameries, Easyvet, and Texas Health for the initial rollout, meaning consumers will be able to order prescription pet meds and ice cream, among other items. 
 
How it works? Retail workers will load up the drones outside participating stores - rather than a Wing facility - carrying small packages that weigh 2.6 lbs or less. They will then climb to a cruise height of around 150 feet above the ground and travel their routes autonomously (remote pilots will be on standby to take control if something goes wrong).",2022-04-08T00:30:47Z,NONE,0.19999998000000202

481,449326922," Roblox ($RBLX -0.8%) is supporting Apple ($AAPL -0.5%) in the tech giant&#39;s antitrust fight against Fortnite maker Epic Games - backing the App Store as beneficial to users. 
 
Epic has appealed a decision that largely went against it last year, when a court decided Apple&#39;s fees and payment rules didn&#39;t reflect anticompetitive behavior (so long as Apple allowed developers to direct users to payment systems besides Apple&#39;s). 
 
Roblox was drawn into the trial last year when Epic said Roblox had gotten a free pass from Apple on the rules. While many consider Roblox a videogame, more than that, it&#39;s a platform that allows for the creation of numerous videogames. 
 
Now Roblox is backing up the App Store. &quot;Apple&#39;s process for review and approval of apps available on the App Store enhances safety and security, and provides those apps greater legitimacy in the eyes of users,&quot; Roblox said Thursday. 
 
Epic is 40% owned by Tencent ($TCEHY +6.2%). $GOOG $GOOGL

Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB +0.2%) has broken up the team of hundreds that were working on new operating systems for its virtual reality and augmented reality devices, The Information reports. 
 
A group of more than 300 employees had been tasked with a new OS for its VR/AR devices. Code-named XROS, it represented a stab at taking firm control of the code underlying the devices critical to the company&#39;s metaverse future. 
 
Meta had halted development on the project late last year, though, sticking with an open-source version of Google&#39;s ($GOOG, $GOOGL) Android instead for the time being. Now it looks like the company is abandoning pursuing an alternative. 
It also points to Meta trying to put a lid on costs and move faster toward the metaverse as the ad business struggles, the report notes.

Why does it take @Google 60 more days than Amazon to do less? and why is there no similar big buyback announcement.  Isn&#39;t Google a cheaper stock.  
  
Sundar it is time to step it up and keep up with your competitor; announce: 1) Buyback and/or 2) a special dividend or a 3) the start of a regular dividend or 4) better yet all of these.

Don&#39;t know when it will really start to take off, but when it do ahead of split and post split, you would&#39;ve missed one of the best rides in Google of the decade.  So buy on red tapes and be patient. The when of the move launch is unknown but is coming. It could be day days weeks worst a few months.  Google will be 2022 stock of the year.    
 
Also IMHO post split Google will be added to the DOW, and I believe in preparation for that Google will start a moderate regular dividend program.

The UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority has accepted a revised offer of &quot;Privacy Sandbox&quot; commitments by Google to address competitive concerns in the company&#39;s Chrome browser. 
 
The CMA launched a probe in January 2021, concerned that the proposals - covering the removal of third-party cookies in Chrome - might concentrate online ad spending even more heavily at Google. 
 
It also expressed concern that the proposals could undermine the ability of online publishers to continue to generate revenue. 
 
Now it says Google&#39;s revisions address those concerns, and that Google has said the commitments will be rolled out globally. 
 
&quot;We now move into a new phase where we will keep a close eye on Google as it continues to develop these proposals.&quot; 
 
The commitments terminate six years from now unless released at an earlier date; the CMA may reopen its investigation and impose other measures if necessary.

If she claims in hind sight that she knew there would be a crash she needed to sell her overvalued stocks and either store proceeds in “cash like” stock like $GOOGL or just buy bonds. But she didn’t manage - she bought overvalued stocks, participated in shit IPOs and spac PIPEs that went down very quickly. As a money manager she should know what price to play for growth. Her strategy of directing massive inflows to non liquid assets is the problem. Any normal fund manager would prevent this but not Cathy. She does her research. Most likely she knows very well what’s she doing and I suspect of foul play. Let it be a lesson to all of us that only we are truly in charge of our money.

SPY is going to remain bullish heavily above the closing week pivot 446.07 as alerted, 
virtually leaving puts worthless feeding them small dips to maintain liquidity.  
After 150 matching ticks within DASH I took notice that SPY price pull was determining  the  
frequency of buy interest within DASH that&#39;s why DASH had delayed pumps, so swinging along SPY calls 
was a no brainer.  
 
Earlier today (11:12AM) just after taking heavy profits off SPY swing I dipped in for the reset fade which  
I identified was forming a bear trap for greedy short remembering 446.07 is the ultimate bearish 
pivot 
 
I scaled GOOGL patiently after ER as its forming the same agro flow pattern as TSLA did into the 
new year and opened New years day for 1200 pump. GOOGL showed no aggressive downside interest alongside 
NASADAQ which is also chasing its 10 &amp; 20 day high 15,260. GOOGL has not yet set its cash session highs.

Note that while a couple of dbag no nothing analysts from no name firms are calling big cap tech&quot;overvalued&quot; and suggesting supply chain problems and &quot;cancelled orders&quot; are a disaster all of the sudden, it is all BS imo.  Take NVDA for example... now trading at call it 2x the relative (S&amp;P 500) multiple... while growing at least 4x as fast, and now the valuation really needs to be discounting NVDA&#39;s new &quot;Grace&quot; (game changing new chipsets available early next year) as a step function up on revenues and margins and ebitda)! The other names above have serious upside catalysts too, none of which are being accorded any value. imo This &quot;gifting&quot;on valuation levels won&#39;t last as hedge funds and ETFs will soon be re-positioning these names (first).  
 
Everyone who wants out at the bottom on these gems ought to hurry now. jmo, but time is running out to turn bs paper losses into a permanent loss of capital.

In a statement obtained by the FT, Microsoft (MSFT) President Brad Smith admitted some of the claims were &quot;valid,&quot; but not all of them. 
 
“While not all of these claims are valid, some of them are, and we’ll absolutely make changes soon to address them,” Smith said, adding that the company is “committed to listening to our customers and meeting the needs of European cloud providers”. 
 
The European Union has reportedly sent a questionnaire to Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) rivals asking about the terms for using Microsoft&#39;s software and if they are at a disadvantage. 
 
On Monday, investment bank UBS said Microsoft (MSFT) was at risk of seeing a &quot;gentle deceleration&quot; in Office 365-related growth as benefits from the pandemic and work-from-home boom are starting to fade.

Microsoft, which has largely escaped the scrutiny from lawmakers around the world that has been placed on some of the other large tech companies may soon find itself in hot water for some business practices relating to its cloud computing unit, Azure. 
 
According to the Financial Times, Microsoft could face an informal antitrust review in Europe over the fact that it is reportedly using certain anti-competitive practices to obtain customers and usher them away from competitors such as Amazon&#39;s ($AMZN) Web Services and Google ($GOOG) ($GOOGL) Cloud. 
 
Microsoft is reportedly tying in Windows and Office to help grow Azure, which critics argue is a similar business practice that brought the last antitrust case against the company in the early 2000s. 
 
Microsoft has said that it can give better terms on its Windows and Office software to customers if they also use Azure.",2022-04-14T00:36:15Z,NONE,0.21739129489603065

Analyst Dan Ives noted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are likely to be &quot;pressured into M&amp;A&quot; and continue to add to their cloud platforms, with Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), Tenable (NYSE:TEN), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), SailPoint (NYSE:SAIL) and Ping (NYSE:PING) as potential acquisition candidates.

&quot;Again, we pose some questions for CFOs of companies with high-priced stocks: if share splits can attract inflows and support prices, do those benefits outweigh the benefits of doing a costly share repurchase? Would a share split and its effects enable management teams to allocate more funds to R&amp;D, raise productivity, or strengthen balance sheets for a rainy day?&quot; 
 
&quot;If more corporate managers adopt shareholder-friendly postures, it could spark a wave of splits and bring more investors flows into the market, proving support for embattled growth companies,&quot; Woodard added.

In an earnings preview note for the Internet group, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion said he is positive on Alphabet (GOOGL) and Snap (SNAP), while being &quot;more neutral&quot; on Pinterest (PINS), Meta Platforms (FB) and Twitter (TWTR). Also, Amazon (AMZN) also &quot;looks more promising&quot; as Street expectations for Q1 are &quot;reasonable&quot; and the company&#39;s year-over-year comparisons will ease as 2022 progresses, Champion tells investors. The analyst noted that his digital ad spending checks for Q1 were mixed as year-over-year spending growth of 10.5% missed expectations by about 2%, driven by spend being pulled into December, Easter falling later in April, and advertisers being uneasy due to events in Russia and Ukraine. In the checks, commentary on Google was &quot;most positive,&quot; while Twitter may have benefited from current events, Champion said.",2022-04-13T14:40:57Z,NONE,0.636363578512402

Meanwhile, it lessens EBITDA risk for Match ($MTCH +1%), Patterson says. &quot;Match&#39;s EBITDA outlook for 2022 assumed flattish margins, which assumed (more than) $650M of app store fees and the view that Match would not have to implement Google&#39;s payment system in April 2022. Since Match noted implementation would represent a ~$60M headwind, investors were concerned about another EBITDA cut.&quot; 
 
Duolingo ($DUOL +2.8%) is earlier in the monetization curve than other digital content businesses, but it could face a large benefit from direct billing as well, Patterson notes: Every 5% of users that shift to direct billing could represent a 1% boost to gross margin for the company.",2022-03-25T00:10:52Z,NONE,0.0

Deutsche Bank agrees that the move could drive incremental subscription additions for Spotify, while roping in the other providers who could see outsize benefits if and when they&#39;re part of the deal: It&#39;s a positive for Warner Music (WMG -1%) and Universal Music (OTC:UNVGY), and dating apps including Match Group (MTCH +1%) and Bumble (BMBL -1.9%) could see a significant margin tailwind if included. 
 
KeyBanc sees the move as a &quot;happy compromise that appeases regulators and large developers without sacrificing Google Play Store revenue or trust and safety.&quot; Ultimately, analyst Justin Patterson expects consumers will gravitate toward payments with large providers like Spotify and continue to use Google Play billing for most other (smaller) services - a &quot;soft landing&quot; scenario for app stores.

2446,446934442," Google&#39;s ($GOOG $GOOGL) deal to allow app developers to bill users directly in-app is starting with a smaller pilot with Spotify $SPOT - but is likely set for far-reaching impact on app makers after a contentious few years in the area of app-store fees. 
 
Spotify analysts are largely positive on the opportunity to boost subscriber growth. 
 
Benchmark&#39;s Matthew Harrigan maintained a Buy rating and a $260 price target on Spotify, implying 78% upside, noting the move &quot;reduces user communications friction.&quot; It&#39;s high-impact for Spotify: Its app has been installed nearly 1 billion times from the Google Play Store, Sensor Tower has reported, and Spotify makes up 180 million premium users of a global total of 523 million paid streaming accounts. 
 
J.P. Morgan echoes that the move should &quot;reduce friction&quot; in Spotify sign-ups. It doesn&#39;t change the firm&#39;s view that Google Play payment enforcement will move forward in April, but that&#39;s understood by investors, the firm said.",2022-03-25T00:09:15Z,NONE,0.799999960000002

2779,440804224,"Spotify ($SPOT) has shut down its Russia office &quot;indefinitely&quot; and removed all content from Kremlin-backed RT and Sputnik from its platform, amid Russia&#39;s attack on Ukraine. 
 
It&#39;s not stopping its general service to Russia, however, telling Variety it&#39;s &quot;critically important to try to keep our service operational in Russia to allow for the global flow of information.&quot; 
 
The company says it&#39;s providing individual support to its regional employees, as well as its global Ukrainian employees, and is matching employee donations for humanitarian aid two-to-one. 
 
RT and Sputnik also ran into trouble with Google ($GOOG, $GOOGL), which blocked mobile apps connected to the state media entities from its Play app store. Google had previously moved to remove the publishers from its news features. Apple ($AAPL) has ensured that RT News and Sputnik News were no longer able to be downloaded from its App Store outside Russia.

One of the most important things to track is social momentum and social sentiment. When a ticker starts to gain traction, more people see it , and it can start to take off. When this happens it usually leads to increased price action and volume. Remember, at the end of the day the market is set by whatever price some is will to buy and sell at.

As for returning cash to shareholders, along with the amendment to its $50 billion share repurchase authorization, Tigress expects another &quot;significant&quot; buyback authorization to come when Q1 results arrive in April.

Futures don&#39;t look great but it is a bit too early to tell. Will be watching my feed and keeping an eye on alerts. Should have a better sense tomorrow for pre-market.

The Evercore analyst contended that the high-quality names will offer a refuge for &quot;the foreseeable future, two or three months,&quot; at which point the situation on interest rates should become clearer. 
 
At that point, &quot;you&#39;ll start seeing high-growth, high-multiple names come back, but we&#39;re still a ways from that,&quot; Mahaney said. 
 
To underline Mahaney&#39;s point, $GOOGL $GOOG and $AMZN have both posted declines between 7% and 8% for 2022 so far. This almost exactly tracks the S&amp;P 500, which has dropped a little less than 8% since the start of the year. 
 
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3806924-high-quality-tech-can-survive-witchs-brew-of-russia-fed-risks-evercore-analyst",2022-03-01T01:38:33Z,NONE,0.0
4077,440103864," Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney said Monday that stock market volatility related to Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine added to the &quot;witch&#39;s brew&quot; of concerns for the tech sector, but investors can weather the uncertainty by turning to &quot;highest-quality&quot; names in the sector. 
 
Speaking to CNBC, the Evercore ISI head of internet research pointed to Amazon ($AMZN) and Google ($GOOG)($GOOGL) as examples of &quot;the names in terms of business models and in valuations&quot; that have performed best during the recent volatility. 
 
Mahaney noted that these have performed significantly better than &quot;future-profitability, high-multiple stocks,&quot; which have seen some of the heaviest selling during recent market downturns. 
 
While conceding that the Ukraine invasion added geopolitical risk, Mahaney pinpointed interest rates as the main concern for tech stocks. He argued that worries about Federal Reserve policy have been the main source of pressure on the more speculative parts of the market.

Why are companies reluctant? 
 
&quot;Some see prestige in a higher stock price,&quot; he said. &quot;Others focus on ‘serious investors’, whether institutions or ETF behemoths.&quot; 
 
About &quot;25% of individual investors are new to markets,&quot; Laidler added. &quot;US household equity ownership is at records.&quot; 
 
&quot;Retail investors are overlooked in stock splits but also fundraisings, investor events, management access, and research provision. Tech mega caps are taking a stock split lead, but many others should follow.&quot;

The number of companies doing stocks splits has plunged, eToro strategist Ben Laidler points out Friday. 
 
&quot;We think this reflects an over-focus on institutional investors and further overlooks the rising importance of individual retail investors,&quot; Laidler wrote in a note. 
 
A split changes nothing about a stock or a company. 
 
But &quot;it may open it to a broader investor base, improve tradability, signal management&#39;s positive outlook, and better allocate stock compensation,&quot; Laidler said. &quot;Data clearly shows a pickup in retail ownership after stock splits, and a bump in share price performance. A lower price could also open up to Dow (DJI) (NYSEARCA:DIA) index inclusion. Fractional share ownership has become more available but is still far from ubiquitous.&quot;",2022-03-12T02:12:43Z,NONE,0.3333333148148158

Google says AMP is still a helpful way for sites that don&#39;t even have large digital teams to build a great mobile Web experience, but publishers are looking to the prospect of 20% greater advertising revenue on non-AMP pages at similar speeds. 
 
The Washington Post made its departure from the AMP program last summer.

Companies including Vox Media, Complex Networks ($BZFD) and Bustle Digital Group are testing or considering their own mobile-optimized article pages, a departure from Google&#39;s Accelerated Mobile Pages - hosted on Google&#39;s servers as a move to speed mobile loading, but which has made publishers slightly more reliant on Google. 
 
Google&#39;s AMP was introduced in 2015, and it drew mention in the 2020 antitrust lawsuit from state attorneys general, which alleged the AMP pages were designed to make it harder for ads to be auctioned anywhere but on Google&#39;s exchange. 
 
Publishers have argued that moving away from AMP for mobile Web experiences would give them more control and also ease and boost ad sales through header bidding, which takes up more data and slows pages on AMP.",2022-02-25T00:51:29Z,NONE,0.4545454338842984

&quot;Some of the outperformance is likely due to momentum. Companies that announce splits have likely seen sustained market outperformance and expect that outperformance to continue,&quot; they added. &quot;Underlying strength in the company is a primary driver of elevated prices. Once the split is executed, investors who have wanted to gain or increase exposure may start to rush for the chance to buy.&quot; 
 
&quot;Stock split announcements have become increasingly scarce over the past decade with the bulk of splits coming before 2000. There have been just 28 stock split announcements in the past five years compared to the peak of 346 between 1996 and 2000. The average 12 month return over the last five years has been 20.9% after split announcements.&quot; 
 
&quot;Performance is not always positive after a split,&quot; they said. &quot;Stocks see negative returns about 30% of the time 12 months later (-22% average).&quot;

While it does not change fundamentals, the split can increase liquidity, analyst Justin Post said. 
 
&quot;Alphabet shares are currently the most expensive on the NASDAQ, trading near $2,800,&quot; the BofA Research Investment Committee wrote in a note. &quot;A 20:1 split would mean the company will trade at about $140/share.&quot; 
 
&quot;Based on Bloomberg corporate action data since 1980, S&amp;P 500 stocks that have announced stock splits have significantly outperformed the index 3, 6, and 12 months after the initial announcement,&quot; they said. &quot;Stocks that have split on average gained 25% over the next twelve months, versus 9% gains for the broad index.&quot;

One part focuses on apps, including for navigation, that are provided via the infotainment screens in autos.

Car co.s are prevented from, for example, mixing Google Maps w/ voice assistants developed by smaller rivals. 
 
The other focuses on app &amp; website developers. Specifically, the dept is looking at Google&#39;s requirement that if a website or app uses one Google tech, say Google&#39;s location search, the website or app developer cannot use maps or other tech developed by Google’s rivals.

White pointed out that Google Cloud has seen &quot;rapid growth&quot; in recent years, most recently growing revenue 45% year-over-year in its most recent to $5.54 billion, with total 2021 revenue at $19.2 billion.  
 
According to industry researcher Canalys, Amazon&#39;s AWS generated $53.5 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, account for 33% of the market. Microsoft (MSFT) had an estimated 22%, while Google was well behind them at 9%.Other cloud providers, including IBM (IBM) accounted for 36% of the overall cloud infrastructure market. 
 
On Wednesday, Boeing (BA) tapped Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), as well as Microsoft (MSFT), and (AMZN) for a cloud computing deal that some believe may be worth more than $1 billion.",2022-04-10T01:38:20Z,NONE,0.4999999375000079
5548,451187564," White said that BigLake was the most &quot;significant&quot; announcement of the event, as it will expand on Google BigQuery and extend the cloud data warehouse on top of data lakes in a multi-cloud environment. BigQuery competes with the likes of Snowflake, AWS&#39;s Redshift and Azure&#39;s Snynapse, with Google describing it as a “a data lake storage engine, to remove data limits by unifying data lakes and warehouses.&quot; 
 
Essentially, it lets companies unify data warehouses and lakes to analyze their data without worrying about a storage format change or system upheaval. 
 
Another innovation of note was the Spanner change stream, which is expected to launch this quarter, White said. This is Google&#39;s relational database that is capable of performing more than 2 billion requests per second at its peak. 
 
the new stream has a number of numbers, including having the &quot;freshest data as they can easily replicate changes from Spanner to BigQuery for real-time analytics.”

Monness, Crespi, Hardt analyst Brian White, who rates Alphabet a buy with a $3,850 price target, implying nearly 40% upside, noted that Google&#39;s recent Data Cloud Summit saw the company unveil a number of new innovations all of which boost the strength of Google Cloud. 
 
White noted that a number of innovations were unveiled at the summit, all of which had the objective to allow “customers to work with limitless data, across all workloads, and extend access to everyone.” 
 
Innovations like BigLake, Spanner change streams, Vertex AI Workbench, Vertex AI Model Registry and Connected Sheets for Looker were all deemed impressive, with White calling them &quot;key,&quot; especially BigLake.

The purchase price of the deal was not reported and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Seeking Alpha. 
 
Two of Google&#39;s largest competitors, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:$FB) are reportedly developing or developing their own augmented reality headsets.

For starters, the NSE will launch trading in 8 major US stocks and more names will be added in a phased manner. Fractional ownership is also permitted making it more affordable for Indians to invest in US equities. This is a big deal because stocks like $AMZN, and $GOOGL cost over Rs 2 Lakh. Also worth mentioning that with this approach, investors won’t actually own the stock. They’ll own receipts issued by the exchange, similar to how $BABA lists in the US.  
 
Investing in US equities directly is fast gaining popularity in India. But the process is cumbersome and costs are very high. These measures are sure to make US investing more accessible for retail investors but limited options and lack of clarity on key issues like brokerage and trade settlement are key hurdles currently. 😶",2022-03-03T13:12:49Z,NONE,0.5238094988662143

5922,447729772," Tesla ($TSLA) has taken steps to pursue a stock split. Elon Musk&#39;s EV giant has begun the preliminary measures necessary to conduct a stock dividend, part of a process meant to split its stock. 
 
The company has requested stockholder approval to increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock, a move that will enable a stock split of the firm&#39;s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. 
Shares holders will vote on the measure at its upcoming 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
The company&#39;s Board of Directors has approved the management proposal, but the stock dividend will be contingent on final Board approval. 
Previously, the company executed a five-for-one split in August 2020 to make owning the stock easier for its employees and investors.

Microsoft shares tumbled on Monday after investment bank UBS said the tech giant could start to see a &quot;gentle deceleration&quot; in Office 365-related growth. 
 
Analyst Karl Keirstead, who rates Microsoft buy with a $360 price target, noted that Office 365 is the company&#39;s second-largest product, behind Azure and likely generated $35.1 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue, growing at between 19% and 21% quarter-over-quarter for the last six quarters. 
 
But given that it likely has &quot;high penetration&quot; and benefits from the pandemic and work-from-home boom are starting to fade, Office 365 growth could start to slow. 
 
Keirstead added that Microsoft remains the dominant franchise in the employee productivity software market, with the race between it and Google ($GOOG) ($GOOGL) &quot;effectively over&quot; and is now trying to displace Microsoft Azure by making Google Cloud more competitive.",2022-04-11T22:21:52Z,NONE,0.6249999609375024

It has fallen a lot for these days, which made me re-evaluate the business logic of this company. The new single-user cost of Bilibili is RMB 500+. According to the current payment rate of less than 10%, paying users need to create 5,000+ net profits to cover the cost of customer acquisition. If the gross profit rate is calculated at 20%, a single customer must provide RMB 25,000 in revenue. Even if it is calculated on a 10-year basis, can you spend RMB 2,500 on Bilibili every year?  
 
Don&#39;t compare a small workshop matching platform like Bilibili with $NFLX, the content production capabilities are very different; don&#39;t compare with YouTube of $GOOGL&#39;s algorithm, the information before advertising is insurmountable.

GOOG or GOOGL: Which Stock Do You Buy? 
 
Google last split its stock in April 2014, which created the A- and C-share classes. Like any other one-for-one split, the number of shares doubled, and the price dropped in half. However, there is one crucial difference: The A-shares receive one vote, while the C-shares receive no votes. Anyone who held A-shares at the time of the split received an equal number of C-shares, but their voting power did not increase.

Russia&#39;s communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, has accused Facebook of &quot;censorship&quot; and acted to slow Facebook&#39;s access to Russian users (after Facebook worked to limit access to accounts of Kremlin-backed media). 
 
Tuesday&#39;s news follows closely on the prospect that Internet companies including Meta and Google face possible punishment for failing to open local offices, among other measures that Russia legally required. Social media companies with more than 500,000 daily users are required to open local offices or face restrictions as harsh as outright bans.

Of 13 companies that fit that threshold, only a few appear to have complied with the local-office requirement (Apple, Spotify and Rakuten&#39;s Viber).

I have been using Duck Duck Go a recently because I can&#39;t stand the censorship that google uses on its search engine.

However, the search results are censored and its quite surprising how much they are. Recently I needed to find Kyle Rittenhouse media accountability project homepage but could not find it on google. 
 
Kyle Rittenhouse has a media accountability project to hold the lying media accountable. 
 
If you use google and search &quot;media accountability project&quot; you will not find their webpage. 
 
Go to Duck Duck Go, and search &quot;media accountability project&quot; you will get their website right on the top where it should be.

Based on its growth, earnings and outlook,  IMHO anything under $3000 is an oversold opportunity. A great gift. 
 
It is time for one or two meaningful catalyst straight from Google&#39;s C-suite: 
 
1) a special dividend ($50-$100 what good is cash in bank in inflationary times?  Send some to shareholders!) 
2) a big buy back. Business is great time to cut outstanding shares ahead of 20 X 1 split).

Nonetheless, there seems to be a significant resistance level at around the $3k mark. Since November, it has continued to impede the stock&#39;s advance as sellers hovered around it.

March 21, 2022 10:50 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Movers
Shopify Inc (NYSE:SHOP) shares are trading significantly lower on above-average volume Monday. The stock may be pulling back after staging a sizable rally into Friday&#39;s market close. 

Shopify&#39;s average session volume is about 2.5 million over a 100-day period, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Monday&#39;s trading session is already nearing 2 million in volume about one hour into trading.

Shopify is trending across social media platforms. It was among the top two trending stocks on Stocktwits at publication time. 

On Friday, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched its Last Mile Fleet Solution, which aims to help other companies that already have truck fleets operate more efficiently. Google&#39;s last mile solution may compete most closely with Shopify since the company offers customers delivery and warehousing solutions.",2022-03-21T18:24:18Z,NONE,0.7499999531250029

‘The Metals Company’ (NASDAQ: TMC)

This penny stock will hit double digits soon.

The company has an estimated total resource of 1.6 billion mt of polymetallic nodules over two mining contracts in the CCZ, although will initially focus on the first project, NORI-D, which covers around 22% of the total resource.

The initial NORI-D project will start with one collector robot and one converted drill ship, which is the vessel that has been converted by its partner and investor, Allseas, from an offshore oil and gas asset and will be tested in 2022.

NORI-D is eventually to be expected to ramp up to produce 119,000 mt/year of nickel, 2.8 million mt/year of manganese, 89,000 mt/year of copper and 9,000 mt/year of cobalt.

7895,448239267," In addition, U.S. users have spent anywhere between 1% and 19% less time year-over-year over the past four quarters, with total minutes falling to 2017 levels, something Nowak categorized as &quot;troubling given the importance of engagement to driving monetization.&quot; 
 
Similar to Meta Platforms&#39; (FB) Facebook, Pinterest is transitioning its users towards creator videos, akin to Facebook&#39;s Reels, Nowak pointed out. 
 
While the potential for higher monetization is possible over time, it&#39;s likely that the pace for better monetization will be &quot;relatively slow&quot; throughout the industry due to high competition, low ad loads and continued testing and learning, the analyst added. 
 
It&#39;s also possible that Meta and other advertisers, such as Alphabet (GOOG) &quot;will be advantaged in their ability to monetize this format over smaller players like Pinterest,&quot; Nowak stated.

Snap (SNAP +3.9%), meanwhile, has managed through the Apple iOS privacy challenge &quot;rather quickly&quot; and so the firm sees it returning to its 2021 analyst day playbook of &quot;innovating to drive advertiser growth and improve ad efficacy/targeting/measurement to increase ad spend per advertiser, auction bid density and ad unit pricing.&quot; Snap may be closer than expected to getting back to 50%-plus growth, it says.

The firm is staying overweight on Alphabet (GOOG +0.9%, GOOGL +1%) and has a $3,450 target on GOOGL, saying it&#39;s &quot;still an innovation-driven cash flow story.&quot; Retail search changes will still have legs even as e-commerce slows, it notes, and recent changes in online travel search and auto search - combined, roughly the same size as retail - will keep driving growth, it says. 
 
Meta (FB +1.9%) is &quot;not out of the Reel woods yet.&quot; Monitoring the slope of adoption of Reels (Meta&#39;s TikTok feature rival) and how quickly it&#39;s monetized is key to Meta&#39;s ability to deliver upward revisions in 2022, the firm says, and for the moment, Street estimates look a bit high. It may take a couple of quarters to deliver, but Morgan Stanley is bullish on a 12-month perspective.",2022-03-29T23:08:53Z,NONE,0.39999996000000404

&quot;Further, we also estimate Russia alone makes up ~1-2% of ad revenue for the ad platforms (with the largest players like GOOGL/FB toward the higher end),&quot; Nowak says, &quot;and we have seen companies across the space pull back or essentially shut down their Russian ad businesses.&quot; 
That leads Morgan Stanley to trim ad revenue estimates for 2022 by about 1-2%, though it&#39;s leaving 2023 unchanged, if with a watchful eye. 
 
It also brings price target trims. The firm cut its target on Twitter (TWTR +2.7%) to $58 from $59 (still implying 45% upside); it cut Snap (SNAP +3.9%) to $59 from $60 (implying 57% upside); cut Criteo (CRTO +4.2%) to $37 from $40 (implying 28% upside); and cut Nextdoor (KIND -0.2%) to $6.50 from $7.00.",2022-03-29T23:08:33Z,NONE,0.46666663555555765

Morgan Stanley has given a mild haircut to price targets for some advertising-centric technology names, pulling back on estimates amid the macro uncertainty of the geopolitical situations. 
&quot;The winds of macro uncertainty continue to swirl around the advertising markets ... in particular within Europe,&quot; analyst Brian Nowak says. That follows key companies pointing to some European weakness in the ad markets. 
 
Europe plays a variable role in tech giants&#39; revenues, the firm notes; the continent makes up anywhere from 8% of revenue (at Pinterest (PINS -0.2%)) to 34% (at Meta Platforms (FB +1.9%)). And softness there could be coming from not only branded advertisers pausing spend to stay away from negative content, but also incremental weakness from the European consumer.",2022-03-29T23:07:45Z,NONE,0.6666666111111158

PART - 4

👉 $GOOGL : Google stock climbed 2.8% to 2,797.36. GOOGL stock reclaimed its 200-day line, but a little more convincingly than Microsoft did. This is also an early entry or Long-Term Leader buy point. The official entry is 3,031.03 on a consolidation going back to early February, though Google stock has been moving sideways.

👉$BABA : Alibaba stock soared Tuesday as the China e-commerce giant raised its stock buyback program by two-thirds, as it fights off regulatory scrutiny. It comes after it increased its share buyback program from $15 billion to $25 billion, effective through March 2024. While it topped its 50-day line, it remains rooted below its 200-day moving average.

The lawsuit, which alleges a pattern and practice of racial discrimination, was filed on behalf of April Curley and other former and current Black employees at Google. Curley said she was unlawfully terminated from her position after she told managers she was creating a report on Google’s &quot;discriminatory&quot; practices, a press release stated.

Released on Tuesday, the report says that the hacking group known as APT41,&quot;.. &quot;began targeting at least six state governments starting last spring, and had not let up through the end of February.&quot; 
&quot;The report said that the hackers also targeted a Microsoft-based agriculture database used by 18 states to document livestock health, known as USAHerds.&quot; 
“China almost certainly is capable of launching cyberattacks that would disrupt critical infrastructure services within the United States, including against oil and gas pipelines and rail systems,” the document said.

8289,432667024,"$GOOGL Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, said (via Bloomberg), “The reason for the split is it makes our shares more accessible. We thought it made sense to do.” What that means is the split makes GOOG stock more accessible for retail investors like you and me. Currently, GOOG stock is sitting right around $3,000 per share, which makes buying even one share hard for the average investor. But after the split (if GOOG stock were to still be $3,000 per share right before), one share of GOOG would only cost $150 per share, making it much more affordable to retail investors.

When do GOOG shares split? According to The Wall Street Journal, shareholders of record as of July 1, 2022 will receive an additional 19 shares for every share they own on Friday, July 15. The stock will then begin trading under its split-adjusted price on Monday, July 18",2022-02-02T14:58:43Z,Bullish,0.4285714081632663

When $TSLA and $AAPL announced their splits in the summer of 2020, the stocks exploded. People are wondering if Amazon’s stock split will inspire the same reaction. 
 
It could, especially if the market responds favorably from these levels. But just like the overall market, I am cautious on that reaction for two reasons. 
 
I believe stock splits are reacted to favorably when the environment is favorable. In the summer of 2020, bulls were in control and risk was running wild. In 2022, that’s not the case thus far.

After nearly four years, Google&#39;s (GOOG -0.7%, GOOGL -0.8%) appeal over a record antitrust fine from the European Union is set for a decision in September, Bloomberg reports. 
 
The EU&#39;s General Court has set Sept. 14 for a decision date on the appeal of the fine that equals about $4.7 billion. 
That fine came tied to Google&#39;s approach with its Android operating system. But that&#39;s just one of three lines of attack from the European Commission on the search giant&#39;s market power. 
 
EC chief Margrethe Vestager has imposed the equivalent of more than $9 billion in fines on the company, with major probes into Android, shopping search and digital advertising.

Bloomberg) -- U.S. consumers don’t expect red-hot inflation levels to last in the long term.

That’s the takeaway from the January consumer survey from Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which showed that the median one-year-ahead inflation expectations fell for the first time since October 2020, to 5.8%. The outlook over three years dropped even more sharply, and the decline was broad-based across age, education and income.

9250,450463560," Google (($GOOG) -2.7%, ($GOOGL) -2.9%) has banned dozens of apps from its Google Play store after finding they include a piece that surreptitiously harvests data. 
 
That offending code comes from a Panamanian company linked through records to a Virginia defense contractor 
 
The Panamanian company, Measurement Systems, paid developers worldwide to incorporate its software development kit into apps. And the code ran on millions of Android devices, inside popular consumer apps including several Muslim prayer apps, a highway speed-trap detection app, and a QR code-reading app. 
 
Google says apps containing Measurement Systems&#39; software were removed from the Play Store as of March 25 
 
The code could continue gathering data on phones where it&#39;s installed, however. The two researchers, Serge Egelman and Joel Reardon, found the code stopped collecting data and unplugged itself shortly after they began publicizing their findings.

Boeing said Wednesday it is hiring Amazon ($AMZN), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Google ($GOOG) ($GOOGL) to help with a digital makeover aimed at giving its airplane designers and software developers more tools, Bloomberg reports. 
 
The multiyear agreements are part of Boeing&#39;s plan to shift hundreds of applications to the cloud, where they will be stored and maintained in the tech companies&#39; data centers. 
 
Boeing is upgrading its technology to help address quality lapses and production issues that drive up costs of developing new aircraft. 
 
Boeing did not disclose financial terms, but The Information had reported last year that Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft&#39;s Azure were competing for a contract worth more than $1B over several years. 
 
&quot;These partnerships will strengthen our ability to test a system - or an aircraft - hundreds of times using digital twin technology before it is deployed,&quot; Boeing chief information officer Susan Doniz said.",2022-04-06T23:46:03Z,NONE,0.5555555246913597

A European Union document indicates that the European Commission is moving forward with a plan to charge big platforms like Google, Meta Platforms (FB -0.7%), Twitter (TWTR +2.5%) and others up to 0.1% of their global annual net income. 
 
That &quot;supervisory fee&quot; could raise €20 million-€30 million ($22 million-$32.8 million) per year, EC chief Margrethe Vestager said last month. 
 
The fee would be a first for the EU executive, and it would be set &quot;based on the estimated costs the Commission incurs in relation to its supervisory tasks.&quot;

If you’re going to say it’s “disinformation”, back up your claims. I promise that you cannot.

Why are verifable lies and literal propaganda campaigns allowed to thrive/even amplified on these crooks platforms, while anything questioning the corporate media narrative is quashed?

Come on, people. It’s right in front of your face.

The Alphabet conglomerate must and will fall, and you can be a part of it. Leave behind those who abuse your (and all of our) rights to freedom of information and freedom of speech. Stop supporting evil.

New, neutral tech is waiting for you on the other side.

👉 $AAPL : Apple stock rose 3.5% to 162.95, a solid gain on below-average volume. Shares are working on a 176.75 double-bottom buy point. Investors could use a trendline break around the 50-day line as an aggressive entry. The RS line for AAPL stock has been holding at highs.

👉 $GOOGL : Google stock popped 5% to 2668.40. Shares will soon have a new base with a 3,031.03 buy point, but they&#39;ve been consolidating since mid-November or even earlier.

Analyst Justin Post says Alphabet is facing difficult year-over-year comps in 2022, but the stock split underscores Alphabet&#39;s shareholder friendly management team. Post says Alphabet has more earnings stability than many of its big tech peers.

- Goods inflation has been low for two decades prior to the pandemic due to efficient supply chain and continuous cost improvements

- The pandemic upend that balance. Unable to spend on services such as gym and travel due to lockdown, people spent their money on goods, just as global supply chains were disrupted 
- Reopening will shift that balance toward its traditional mix. Plus supply chain easing will cool down goods inflation too.

Provisions would allow developers to make their apps available to iPhone users without going through Apple&#39;s (AAPL) App Store and could limit how sites such as Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) can rank their own products and services ahead of those offered by smaller competitors in search results, according to the report. The Wall Street Journal previously said Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Booking (BKNG) and Alibaba (BABA) would be impacted.",2022-03-25T12:30:03Z,NONE,0.21739129489603065

11318,437011683," Oppenheimer is sticking up for Digital Turbine stock ($APPS -12.3%) - caught in a downdraft coming from Google&#39;s initiative to cut back advertising tracking on its Android mobile device operating system. 
 
Google plans to support existing ad platform features for at least two years, delaying any pain for related companies (which are slumping today). But in any case, the proposed changes could make Digital Turbine a beneficiary rather than a victim, Oppenheimer says. 
&quot;Although the initial reaction is gut-wrenching caution for all ad-tech names, this will only further bifurcate the sector into the haves and have-nots, in our opinion, with Digital Turbine firmly in the winning category,&quot; the firm says. 
 
The move looks to be &quot;hastening the urgency for larger impacted players to tap into APPS&#39; superior proprietary data/products,&quot; it says. 
Oppenheimer has an Outperform rating on Digital Turbine.

Google ($GOOG $GOOGL) implicitly criticized Apple&#39;s ($AAPL) approach in its announcement, saying , &quot;We realize that other platforms have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers. We believe that — without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path — such approaches can be ineffective and lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses.&quot; 
 
Google says its goal is to develop effective and privacy-enhancing solutions to reassure users and benefit developers and businesses. It will support existing ad platform features for at least two years and give &quot;substantial&quot; notice of changes. 
 
Google included a statement of support from Snap (SNAP) in its announcement. Snap (SNAP) said its has &quot;made privacy a priority and placed it at the center of how we design our products. We are excited to collaborate with Google to develop new privacy-preserving standards for Android.&quot;",2022-02-16T22:50:42Z,NONE,0.6666666444444451
11321,437010658," Google ($GOOG -0.7%, $GOOGL -0.7%) is building its Privacy Sandbox on the Android mobile device operating system - a move that follows Apple ($AAPL -1%) in cutting back ad tracking on smartphones, and which comes with heavy implications for social media and digital advertising firms. 
 
It&#39;s a multi-year initiative to provide what Google calls, &quot;new, more private advertising solutions&quot; that will &quot;limit sharing of user data with third parties and operate without cross-app identifiers, including advertising ID.&quot; 
 
The company says it&#39;s also exploring technologies to reduce the potential for covert data collection. 
 
Alongside Apple&#39;s  privacy changes to iOS, Google&#39;s move could help accelerate the end of long-entrenched advertising approaches on smartphones.
