  to become a master of intraday trading, one needs to know winning setups. Here&#39;s one that easy to follow and low risk 
The 40 min buy setup following an opening gap  
1. stock must gap over a point at the open  
2. best if stock does not rally much from opening price  
(stocks  which  gap and then stall make the best candidates)  
3. let  the stock trade for at least 40 minutes  
4. after 40 mins or longer, set a buy-stop or alert to buy a bit above it&#39;s daily high. Also set a protective stop a bit below the day&#39;s low.  
example 3/15/2022  Home Depot   
1. HD closed on 3/14/2022   318.53  
2. HD open price 3/15/2022  320.35  
3. HD price 40 min into the session 322+  
4.  HD high in first 40 min was 323.29 ish  
5.  set buy-stop or alert at 323.33   
6.  your buy hit about 10 min later 323.33 ish , also set protective stop at 320.37 ish.   
7. HD ends the day at 327.02  and never dropped below you buy price.

Construction spending in the US inched up 0.2 percent from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of USD 1.640 trillion in December of 2021, following an upwardly revised 0.6 percent advance in December and missing market expectations of a 0.6 percent gain. Spending on private construction rose 0.7 percent, mostly new single family residential construction (2.1 percent), amusement and recreation (3.3 percent) and lodging (2.1 percent). On the other hand, public construction outlays fell 1.6 percent, weighed down by transportation (-3.0 percent), educational (-1.4 percent), and sewage and waste disposal (-3.9 percent). source: U.S. Census Bureau

Commenting on the supply chain situation, the Lowe&#39;s CEO contended that the firm&#39;s scale allowed it to sidestep some of the bottlenecks faced by other retailers.

Gross margin improved to 32.9% of sales from 31.8% a year ago as sales leverage helped to offset some input cost and labor inflation.

The reaction to LOW&#39;s earnings report stood in stark contrast to rival Home Depot (NYSE:HD), which dropped nearly 9% on Tuesday in the wake of its quarterly update. While HD exceeded expectations with its latest results, the company said its 2022 comparable sales growth would be only &quot;slightly positive.&quot; The firm also warned about ongoing volatility in lumber prices. 
 
HD&#39;s poorly received report also put pressure on LOW, which dropped about 4% in sympathy. This marked the fourth consecutive day of declines for the stock -- meaning that Wednesday&#39;s post-earnings rally only regained some of its recent losses. 
 
In his CNBC interview, Ellison pushed back on the idea that demand for home improvement would decline following the pandemic. Instead, he argued that the ongoing work-from-home trend and the general focus on homes generated by the COVID lockdowns will lead to an ongoing culture of home improvement.",2022-02-23T23:32:55Z,NONE,0.30769229585798863
1079,438802983," Lowe&#39;s CEO Marvin Ellison said Wednesday that the macroeconomic climate remains hospitable for the home improvement retailer, leading to its Street-beating financial results for the latest quarter. 
 
&quot;We feel good about the macro environment specific to home improvement,&quot; the head of Lowe&#39;s (NYSE:LOW) told CNBC, citing a large stockpile of savings consumers have built up during the pandemic. 
 
Ellison also pointed to dynamics in the housing market for its strong results, noting continued home price appreciation, which gives homeowners the &quot;confidence to invest in their homes.&quot; In addition, he noted an undersupply situation in the housing market, as well as an aging housing stock, saying this would spur demand for maintenance and repairs. 
 
Lowe&#39;s (LOW) rallied about 3% in Wednesday&#39;s intraday trading following the release of better-than-expected Q4 results. The company beat projections on both its top and bottom lines. The firm also gave a solid forecast for 2022.

Goldman: The extreme supply-demand imbalance in today‚Äôs housing market will likely dampen the hit to activity from higher rates. 
 
We  find that housing starts have historically been unresponsive to changes in mortgage rates in a supply-constrained environment, likely because homebuilders are able to continue building with little fear that homes will sit vacant after completion 
 
While higher mortgage rates will help to slow home price growth, we estimate that the current tightness of the housing market and blistering near-term momentum will support just over 10% home price growth this year (Q4/Q4). We expect home price growth to slow more substantially beyond this year: our model points to low single-digit home price growth by mid-2023, a pace we previously did not expect to reach until 2024",2022-04-21T00:33:38Z,NONE,0.7333332844444478

1885,447267764," Lumber futures in Chicago sank below $1,000 per 1,000 board feet for a sixth straight decline, the longest slump since January and capping the biggest weekly loss since July. 
 
Lumber futures have dropped 28% from their early March high of $1,357 per 1,000 board feet, as new home sales fell for the second straight month in February, missing forecasts. 
 
&quot;The price decline is tied to the DIY [do-it-yourself] sector slowing down due to high lumber prices, with people spending their money on other things like travel,&quot; Russ Taylor, president of Russ Taylor Global in Vancouver, told Bloomberg. 
 
Flooding in British Columbia disrupted lumber supplies and lifted prices in late 2021, and volumes that were stuck at mills in western Canada will move more quickly in better spring weather, resulting in more supplies in the market after months of tight inventories, Taylor said.

The reward, however, is big. I believe they do get a sale done by the 5/2 date and everything finalized by the 6/15 date and this goes anywhere from $3 to $8 per share. Extremely low float. Yes, they‚Äôve got debt. They also have over $100m in raw materials. They‚Äôve got $500m in land, buildings, and equipment. They‚Äôve got $60ish million in future work orders. I believe the company fair value is about $250mil.  
 
Full transparency, I‚Äôm holding 21,700 shares at 1.50 now. I might lose $15k. I might make $100k. And it‚Äôs going to happen within the next 60 days.
