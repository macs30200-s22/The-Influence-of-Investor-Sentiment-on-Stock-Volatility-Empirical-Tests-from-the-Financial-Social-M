Like how many times a stock was mention on reddit, but it had all different types of info on it such as the bank fines, government contracts. I tried to find it using google because i have a vision of what it looks like but no such luck. Somebody from here stocktwits was posting so maybe they see our thread &amp; say is this it.

Maybe somebody from 1 of the banks knows.

The extra capital required creates &quot;extra drag&quot; on its return on equity, &quot;effectively reducing whatever our ROE would be by approximately 15%,&quot; he said. 
 
Stock buybacks will be lower because it needs to retain more capital as required by regulators and because of recent acquisitions the bank has made. (Dimon, though, argues against the regulation for boosting its capital reserves.) 
 
As the company had previously disclosed, total expenses will increase by ~$6B this year, with ~$2.5B of that related to people, reflecting inflationary and competitive labor markets. 
 
The $3.5B of additional incremental investments include ~$1B for new branches, bankers and certain marketing expenses; ~$700M &quot;incremental investment&quot; expenses related to acquisitions; additional investment in its consumer expansion that it&#39;s not specifying; and a little less than $2B for technology, R&amp;D and operations.

Due to the elevated risks, JPMorgan&#39;s (JPM) management teams have been working &quot;to be prepared for the unpredictable,&quot; he wrote. 
 
Dimon also provides his input on what the U.S. government should do regarding Ukraine, including ramping up sanctions against Russia and formulating a Marshall Plan to ensure energy security for the U.S. and its allies. 
 
As for what&#39;s coming up for JPMorgan (JPM) itself, Dimon warned investors that the bank will be required to hold 2% more common equity Tier 1 capital as a result of U.S. implementation of G-SIB (globally systemically important banks) requirements.

Furthermore, the bank needed to elaborate on its move into the competitive U.K. retail banking market with its digital retail bank, the people told the Financial Times. Note that the retail bank provides products and features for customers in the U.K. through a mobile app using the Chase brand. “The uncertainty is pretty high [about the UK retail banking push]. I don’t think they’ve provided a lot of metrics to judge success at this point,” one of JPM&#39;s largest shareholders told the Financial Times. 
 
People close to JPM told the Financial Times that they intend to give more detail on its plans at an investor day scheduled for later this year. Despite concerns over big JPM&#39;s spending plans, Seeking Alpha screens the bank&#39;s Profitability Grade with an &quot;A+&quot; rating, reflecting a better return on common equity than the sector median.

1909,447409109," Investors are criticizing JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon over a multibillion-dollar technology spending plan, as well as the lender&#39;s move last year to enter the U.K. retail banking market, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times Wednesday. 
 
In February, JPM investors told Dimon and his leadership team that the bank was not providing enough detail about its technology spending plans, the Financial Times reported, citing three people who attended a meeting in Florida. Moreover, large shareholders are concerned with the bank&#39;s plans to increase spending on new projects in 2022 by 30% to nearly $15B, of which the largest proportion is directed towards technology 
 
“I’ve not talked to one investor globally that has disagreed with our conclusion that JPMorgan needs to provide better transparency on where, why and when they will spend this record amount,” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo told the Financial Times.

From Feb. 17 through March 14, there wasn&#39;t one traditional initial public offering in the U.S., the longest dry spell not resulting from a holiday season, Dealogic said. On Tuesday, March 15, small medical cannabis suppler Akanda (AKAN) raised $16M in an IPO. Still, bankers aren&#39;t expecting an IPO resurgence for some time. 
 
Follow-on share sales and convertible bond offerings have also slowed significantly. The reduced new shares being offered are poised to reduce Q1 2022 revenue after last year&#39;s boom.

Fun fact...

With just $25 and a measly 5% in gains, how many days of compounding would it to take to reach different levels?

Day 1: $25
Day 170: $100k
Day 203: $500k
Day 218: $1 Million
Day 251: $5 Million
Day 265: $10 Million
Day 312: $100 Million
Day 345: $500 Million
Day 359: $1 Billion
Day 365: $1.35 Billion

If that 5% increased to 15% then you would turn $25 into $357 sextillion after 365 compounding periods. With a rate of 10% it would result in $32 quadrillion.

Obviously it&#39;s beyond infeasible to reach even 5% in *daily* compounded gains for an entire year, but it&#39;s a fun thought experiment nevertheless and shows the sheer power of compound interest.

See Consumer credit card report yest.?

Floors me, market began dropping SHORT-LY after c.c. report posted, 3PM EST, yet, posts saying, &quot;Biden war speaking&quot; why SPY drop.
Was it him?

HEY, a c.c. spend # takes time for likes of $JPM &amp; $GS to digest, not a CPI # simplicity.

Consumers, on paper, spent....less December, est. $22B vs actual $18.6B, but, did they?

Note, c.c. RECORD-BREAKING NOV. SPEND OF $39.99B👀
Sure. W.H.O. &amp; CDC, in LATE NOV., were both stressing staying home, as, Black Friday 1st announcement of Omicron was Nov. 24 pre-Thanksgiving Day, Wed.
Convenient, really, as millions of USA shoppers were to shop.
Many stayed home.
1) Omicron &quot;is deadly.&quot; 
2) Omi 42x more contagious than Delta

And, Biden said Dec. 7, &quot;Stay home if not vaxed.&quot;
So many did, still how MUCH DID consumers SPEND Dec.? 18.6B😱
More like, $23-24B, w/o the Omicron &amp; Biden Put.
Why Biden speak? INFLATION🥶

&quot;The Nasdaq has run into resistance again here.... throwing back into the 200-day moving average,&quot; Wilson added. &quot;It&#39;s a good time to remain defensive because, look, we&#39;re late cycle.&quot; 
 
He has been worried the inflation surge and Federal Reserve&#39;s tightening policy increases recession risks. It could create an environment, according to Wilson, where stocks perform worse than bonds.

I don&#39;t think they will, only that they should. Knowing how Powell has handled monetary policy I suspect that double digits may come but it would be over more than a year with 50 basis point hikes per month.

My suggestion wasn&#39;t even to immediately raise interest rates to anywhere near 17%, that would be a dangerously aggressive hike to happen at once. What I suggested was raising it immediately by several percentage points and increasing the 50 basis point per month planned up to 100 basis points.

Right now the current plan is to simply raise rates 0.5% for at least the next two months, which is way too insignificant to even put a bandage on what the situation they&#39;ve put us in.

Dear Messrs Dimon, Moynihan, Solomun

2) Whitehouse (w/ E Warren and Bernie) similar proposal for Oil 
 
3) Canada 3% &quot;surtax&quot; on Banks 
 
As interest rates continue higher - can imagine a matter of time till E Warren and Bernie coming up with another &quot;genius&quot; idea a la  
 
&quot;Hey - not fair banks making more $$$ w/ higher interest rates - we should slap them w/ a &quot;windfall tax&quot; - just like Canada - blah blah blah&quot; 
 
No mention so far - but always good to think ahead - so can get in-front 
 
Perhaps we ask BPI to come up with some analysis on why higher interest rates are a positive for customers, etc ? (similar to their work why negative rates / cap return restrictions are bad for consumers, etc)

To be sure, the crisis could still be resolved without losses for Xiang and his banks. As the world’s largest nickel producer, Tsingshan stands to benefit from the increase in prices if it can weather the storm. And if Xiang holds on to his short position, as he has told his banks he wants to, and nickel prices go down once the LME reopens, the amount of money he owes his banks and brokers would also drop sharply. 
Tsingshan has a short position of about 30,000 tons of nickel directly on the LME, held through brokers CCBI, ICBC Standard Bank and Sucden, the people said.  
 
The remainder of the over 150,000 ton short position is held through bilateral deals with banks like JPMorgan, they said. Many companies prefer to trade via such “over-the-counter” positions, which mean dealing only with the bank and also are subject to much fewer reporting requirements. The banks in turn generally offset their risk by placing short positions on the LME.",2022-03-12T00:29:14Z,NONE,0.4999999750000012
4254,443493902," JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) appears to be caught in the middle of a short squeeze as the largest counterparty to nickel trades by Chinese tycoon Xiang Guangda, Bloomberg reports, citing people familiar with the matter. 
 
About 50K tons of Xiang&#39;s total nickel short position of more than 150K tons is held through an over-the-counter position with JPMorgan (JPM), Bloomberg said. Based on that position, Xiang&#39;s company Tsingshan Holding Group would have owed the New York-based bank ~$1B on margin on Monday. Earlier this week, the news organization reported that Tsingshan has been struggling to pay margin calls to its brokers and banks. 
 
JPMorgan (JPM) is now leading negotiations between Xiang and roughly 10 banks and brokers.  With the rise in nickel prices, the banks and brokers involved in the transactions now have to make large margin calls of their own at the LME to cover the short positions.

In addition, what good does it do to raise rates a measly .25 bps? even if we were to believe these bogus numbers? answer, it does not do a thing.  The only way to combat the hyper inflationary/ stagflationary economy is to pull a Volcker , , , and raise to 20% in one shot.  Of course they don&#39;t have the backbone to do what&#39;s needed and hyper inflation will give us more stagflation.  We are already heading into a recession.  The only way out, is political change.   
 
Watching the ever growing disaster of Xiden/Kommie unfurl, means severe economic pain.  Which is what they want.  So they can manufacture another fake &quot;crisis&quot; to rig an election, and idiots like Kerry can go on making 10&#39;s of millions in the &quot;global warming&quot; scam rackets.

The drawdown seen so far in 2022 appears to vindicate bears, such as Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, who has been arguing for months that rising rates and a less forgiving macroeconomic backdrop will mark the end of equities’ ferocious rally.  
 
At the same time, Bank of America Corp. strategists led by Michael Hartnett reiterated on Friday that the rising “rates shock” will morph into “recession shock,” and advised a short position in equities. 
 
But JPMorgan’s Matejka disagrees. “We think it is wrong to position for a recession given still extremely favorable financing conditions, very strong labor markets, underleveraged consumer, strong corporate cash flows and banks’ strong balance sheets,” he wrote.

&quot;Fed Driven Recession...&quot;

This comes shortly after Dimon said exactly what I posted yesterday (linked below) when asked about interest rate hikes, that a 100 basis point hike over 2 months will have little impact.

No shit, so why is everyone responsible for monetary policy refusing to do what&#39;s needed to dig us out of the hole they put us in?

Oh ya... Because nobody wants to be the one behind the decision that causes a market crash.

The longer this insanity continues, the more painful it will be and the longer it will last. Have some balls and pull the trigger, stop using a water gun to put out a chemical fire.

&quot;We remain optimistic on the economy, at least for the short term — consumer and business balance sheets remain at healthy levels — but see significant geopolitical and economic challenges ahead due to high inflation supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine,&quot; said Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. 
 
For the year, JPMorgan (JPM) boosts its guidance for net interest income ex-Corporate &amp; Investment Bank Markets of $53B+ from its previous estimate of ~$50B. It keeps its outlook for 2022 adjusted noninterest expense at ~$77B. 
 
Q1 earnings reflect a $902M net credit reserve build firmwide, which reduced its EPS by $0.23, reflecting a higher risk of probabilities of downside risks, the bank said on Wednesday.

Investment Banking fees were also &quot;better than feared and were only 5% off consensus,&quot; Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke said in a note. 
 
With expectations that management will likely defer more details on guidance until its May 23 Investor Day, &quot;we think there could be an &#39;air pocket&#39; in the stock today, and see shares lagging the broad market,&quot; Roth Katzke said. 
 
Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr noted JPMorgan&#39;s (JPM) increase in average loans, average deposits, debit and credit card sales volume, and long-term flows in asset &amp; wealth management as other positives for the bank. 
 
Among the issues he sees are: return on tangible common equity fell to 16% from 19% in the prior quarter, investment banking fees falling 31% Y/Y, adjusted PPNR down 13% Y/Y, managed overhead ratio increased 400 bps Y/Y, and home lending originations fell 37% Y/Y.",2022-04-14T00:38:24Z,NONE,0.8888888395061756

Core preprovision earnings of $12.1B came in $823M higher than Oppenheimer&#39;s estimate, due to $1.04B higher &quot;core&quot; revenue on stronger net interest income, investment banking revenue and trading revenue, said analyst Chris Kotowski. 
 
&quot;Most impressive was that FICC trading was down only 1% from what we saw as exceptionally strong levels last year. Also noteworthy is that net interest income was up 7.5% Y/Y, indicating strong underlying growth, even though the rate hike came very late in the quarter and did not add much to the result,&quot; Kotowski wrote in a note to clients. 
 
She points to two factors weighing on the stock — its 120-basis-point decline in CET1 to 11.9% from 13.1% and its lack of specific guidance on 2022 outlook for $53B+ in net interest income, &quot;especially in light of the changes in the forward curve since JPM gave this guide in mid-February.&quot;

They&#39;ve got a whole host of issues right now from a major loss in production due to Shanghai lockdowns to rising costs to supply chain issues to an overall sharp decline in new auto loan originations as reported by $JPM today. 

Considering their obscene valuation of $1.03 trillion with just $5.5 billion in net income (not to mention last quarters deliveries already being flat QoQ) I can&#39;t imagine a positive result after they report.

With that said, they&#39;re still very much a massive bubble filled with hyper euphoric investors so it&#39;s a bit too volatile for me to say how the market will react with any certainty. Could crash 10% before Elon posts a video of him dancing on Twitter to recover all losses.

Biden’s blame game has evolved over the past several months. When inflation started accelerating a year ago, the White House largely downplayed it as &quot;transitory.&quot; 
 
&quot;The overwhelming consensus is it’s going to pop up a little bit and then go back down,&quot; Biden said in June 2021 after inflation increased to 5%.

The about-face came after Wall Street titans JPMorgan Chase ($JPM) and Goldman Sachs ($GS) both said they&#39;re shuttering operations in Russia in light of the country&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. 
 
Just a couple days earlier, the bank said it wouldn&#39;t pull out of the Russian market, noting that its credit exposures to Russia and Ukraine were a &quot;very small portion of the bank&#39;s overall loan portfolio.&quot; 
On Friday, Deutsche Bank (DB) also said it agreed to keep in place until February 2023 a monitor to track is ESG claims at its DWS subsidiary after the U.S. Department of Justice found the bank had violated a deferred prosecution agreement.
