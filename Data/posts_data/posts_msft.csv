The pair‚Äôs initial work was to program the Altair 8800 microcomputer. They then began developing operating systems, getting a contract from IBM for its personal computer in 1980. Five years later, the company introduced Microsoft Windows, which became the dominant operating system for personal computers to this day.  
  
The success of Microsoft made both Gates and Allen multi-billionaires, and Gates held the title of world‚Äôs richest person for several years before he began giving his fortune away. The company they founded is one of the most valuable in the world, with a market capitalization of more than two trillion dollars.

&quot;We think the number of subscribers who will opt for the pricey PS+ Premium package will rise,&quot; Ezawa added. 
 
Ezawa has a buy rating and a price target of $148 or 18,000 yen on Sony (SONY). 
 
The subscription services can also be purchased at a yearly price, at $59.99 for PlayStation Plus Essential and $119.99 for PlayStation Plus Premium. The mid-tier package, called PS Plus Extra, will cost $15 a month, or $100 a year. 
 
PS Plus includes two free games a month and access to multiplayer games online. In addition to that, PS Plus Extra gives subscribers the capability to download 400 PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 titles. 
 
Plus Premium adds an additional 340 games to its catalog and subscribers can stream &quot;a selection&quot; of PS, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PS5 titles online. 
 
Ezawa said the new services offer &quot;greater quality and quantity&quot; and the updated PS+ offers online multi-play at no extra charge, something the previous service did not.

Analyst Kota Ezawa noted that PS+, set to come in three different tiers, is likely to aid Sony if a number of subscribers use the higher-priced PlayStation Plus Premium Service, which is priced at $17.99 per month in the U.S. 
 
&quot;On the top most contract plan, users can freely play up to 740 titles (this number may vary by region) for a monthly charge of ¬•1,550 ($17.99 in the US, ‚Ç¨16.99 in Europe, and GBP13.49 in the UK),&quot; Ezawa wrote, adding that it&#39;s nearly double the current price of the basic package, known as PlayStation Plus Essential.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and Sheldon Whitehouse said, &quot;We are deeply concerned about consolidation in the tech industry and its impact on workers&quot; in a letter to FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan. 
 
The senators want the #FTC review to assess whether the deal could exacerbate the allegations of sexual abuse, harassment and retaliation that have become prevalent as Activision Blizzard faces federal and state probes over misconduct. 
 
Additionally, the four senators noted how the deal&#39;s terms would let embattled Activision (ATVI) Chief Executive Bobby Kotick continue in his role until the deal&#39;s expected closing in 2023, and then receive a potentially large exit package.

According to Windows Central, which closely tracks business dealings at Microsoft (MSFT), the software giant will launch an Xbox Game Pass family plan later this year that will let subscribers share access to their accounts with their family members. No prices for the service have been disclosed, but the new offering will reportedly allow for five users to access games through a single account. 
What is also not known is if the new family plan will be offered separately for Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass service, or if it will only include Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which gives subscribers access to more than 100 Xbox One and Xbox 360 games online.

In other tidbits, the company noted that Call of Duty net bookings on console and PC declined year-over-year, &quot;reflecting lower premium sales for Call of Duty: Vanguard versus the year-ago title and lower engagement in Call of Duty: Warzone. 
 
Call of Duty: Mobile net bookings grew year-over-year in the fourth quarter, however, driven by continued contribution from the game in China.

While all of this sounds promising for Microsoft (MSFT), Thill noted that Power Platform and Power Apps are a &quot;long-term catalyst&quot; for the company, one that could impact all of Microsoft&#39;s products, due to its integration with Teams, Dynamics 365 and Azure. 
 
Assuming everything comes to fruition, Power Platforms, which currently generates less than one-half-of 1% of Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) $199 billion in annual revenue, could wind up becoming worth $6 billion in sales by 2027 if it&#39;s able to grow its user base and ultimately, become &quot;Microsoft&#39;s next pillar of sustainable growth.&quot;

These newly trained developers can build apps using Power Platform&#39;s &quot;PowerPoint-like, drag-and-drop interface with a simple Excel-like coding language,&quot; and put all of their workflow onto one platform, making it easier to create apps. This could cut the development time it takes to create apps, while not to mention being significantly cheaper than previous solutions. 
 
Microsoft  may have its arms in all areas of tech, positioning itself well for the future, but things could get even better for itself and its shareholders if it&#39;s able to see increased Windows-related revenue due to a strong PC market. Shareholders could also see benefits if there are improvements in Azure&#39;s operations and the company returns more cash to shareholders, Thill explained. 
 
Conversely, things could get worse for Microsoft  if COVID-19 continues to be a drag on global growth, the global transition to the cloud takes longer than expected, or some of its ventures prove unprofitable.",2022-03-21T00:45:57Z,NONE

Charles Lamanna, Microsoft&#39;s Corporate Vice President of Business Apps and Platform, said it&#39;s likely that over the next five years, 500M new apps will need to be built, which would be &quot;more than all the apps built in the last 40yrs.‚Äù 
 
Although 500 million apps over the next five years sounds like an enormous opportunity, there&#39;s one big hurdle: there are not enough software developers around the world to meet that demand. 
 
It&#39;s estimated that to reach the 500M figure, an additional 10yrs worth of developers would have to enter the market.

Microsoft generates the vast majority of its revenue from its Azure cloud computing platform, Office 365, and is looking to enhance its profile in video games with its pending Activision ($ATVI) purchase. 
 
But, the company&#39;s next growth engine could be hiding in plain sight, according to investment firm Jefferies. 
 
Analyst Brent Thill, who has a buy rating and a $400-a-share price target on Microsoft&#39;s stock, noted that Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) Power Platform could be its next big opportunity, and potentially bigger than Office. 
 
Thill said that revenue from Power Platform is &quot;immaterial&quot; today, but it could have a larger impact on all of Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) products and become a &quot;multi-billion-dollar growth pillar,&quot; which he compared to &quot;the early days of Azure.&quot;

Boeing is upgrading its technology to help address quality lapses and production issues that drive up costs of developing new aircraft. 
 
Boeing did not disclose financial terms, but The Information had reported last year that Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft&#39;s Azure were competing for a contract worth more than $1B over several years.

4537,442074392," CrowdStrike ($CRWD) is set to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday and even though the cyber security sector has seen a benefit thanks to geopolitical issues, Morgan Stanley notes rising expectations and growing competition point to a &quot;difficult setup&quot; going into the results. 
 
Analyst Hamza Fodderwala, who rates CrowdStrike underweight with a $180 price target, notes that customer additions are &quot;unlikely&quot; to have outpaced a decline in average deal size, which could limit annual recurring revenue. 
 
&quot;Our [fourth-quarter] checks still point to a favorable but consistent demand environment for CrowdStrike, with 61% of resellers above plan in Q4, in line with last quarter,&quot; Fodderwala wrote 
 
&quot;At the same time, we are picking up signs of rising competition and at least a modest uptick in discounting in competitive situations, primarily against SentinelOne ($S) and ($MSFT). Incremental deal sizes are also generally lower on average as CrowdStrike pushes further down market.&quot;",2022-03-08T02:32:37Z,NONE

In addition, Bracelin noted that although Oracle&#39;s (ORCL) cloud growth rose again, with total cloud-related revenue rising 24% year-over-year compared to a 22% rise in the previous quarter, it&#39;s unclear how the cloud shift can &quot;sustain a clear path to double-digit organic growth next year.&quot; More than 70% of Oracle&#39;s (ORCL) revenue are tied to traditional areas, which saw a decline of 1.6% year-over-year this quarter. 
 
The firm also has concerns that Oracle&#39;s ($ORCL) cloud growth could &quot;underwhelm&quot; in the future and the need for more capital for its shift to the cloud could be hampered as it competes with the likes of Microsoft ($MSFT), which is building between 50 and 100 data centers per year.

Analyst Brent Bracelin downgraded Oracle (ORCL) to underweight from neutral and lowered the price target to $70 from $100, noting concerns about operating risks and free cash flow margins. 
 
&quot;Few companies have executed a cloud model transition without a hiccup, and the drag on [free cash flow] margins is well documented and could also temper multiple expansion going forward,&quot; Bracelin wrote in a note to clients. 
 
In addition, the analyst said that the firm prefers stocks like Salesforce ($CRM), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Workday ($WDAY) &quot;that have less near-term operating risk and higher [free cash flow] growth prospects.&quot;",2022-03-12T00:17:28Z,NONE

It is especially tough for tech because this quarter less spending inevitably yet they may THINK they will get Dec. #s.

Even w/o reality of people no longer in homes 24/7 playing tech lime Q4 , as Covid, Delta, Omicron, become distant memories, the fact is a economic slowdown is imminent w/ FED constricting consumer spending in March, might try to bring death to their spending even , with as much as a 1.25% rate hike.

1.25% a little harsh though, dangerous, el risque, so more likely only 0.75-1% initial hike .....

FTC Chair Lina Khan, though - now likely with enough support from aligned commissioners - will examine the deal with an eye to the combined companies&#39; access to consumer data, the game developer labor market and the deal&#39;s impact on those workers who have accused Activision of discrimination and a hostile workplace, according to The Information. And the FTC is also looking into potential impact on a competitive metaverse. 
 
The probe is still in early stages and expectations are that barring an FTC suit, Microsoft can close the deal soonest sometime in 2023. 
 
Prosecutors are examining a meeting that took place between Activision Blizzard chief Bobby Kotick and options traders before the deal was announced. And a group of senators is urging the FTC forward toward a hard review of the transaction, with an emphasis on the labor market implications.

The bulk of attention so far has been on whether Microsoft will restrict competitors like Sony ($SONY -3.3%) from offering Activision titles as part of subscription services, which have been growing in importance for the top videogame players. Microsoft has committed to allowing games for the PlayStation (with a focus on annual best-selling franchise Call of Duty).

- Now HIDDEN bullish divergence with a crash down to shakeout retail. If we see a quick recovery above Fib 0.618 then this is a confirmed spring to backtest and flip the breakout of the red downtrend resistance slope into a support. Confirmation is key.

Jayshree, if we could look further out, one concern that quite a number of investors have is the runway for both Microsoft and Facebook, and the respective 400-gig and 200-gig builds. And I recognize the world is probably not nearly as binary as many of us in the investment community think. But any insight you could share on the runway for those bills and on what‚Äôs next, assuming that at some point they hit peak levels flatten out and eventually roll over? 
 
 
Well, look, we‚Äôre used to volatility from our Cloud Titan customers. We experienced the highs of 2018 and then the lows of 2019 and ‚Äò20. So, we‚Äôre in a period where the Cloud Titans are clearly investing from a CapEx. And increasingly, we are more directly correlated to their network CapEx.

Our cloud business continues to be strong. In 2021, we successfully transitioned from prototype to trials to production on our latest products for 100 gig, 200 gig and 400 gig. The Arista 7800 is now deployed at scale for data center spine, PCI and regional spines and AI spine clusters. The Arista 7388, which we co-developed with Meta and announced at OCP, November last year, is also now running successfully in production data centers. We not only continue to do well in existing use cases, but are also winning in new areas like WAN and Cloud Edge. 
 
Feedback from our largest customers is consistent. Arista products are easier to work with and have far fewer issues than competition.

&quot;In terms of Q4 2021 verticals, Cloud Titans was our largest vertical, followed by the enterprise, followed by the specialty cloud providers at third place, financials at fourth place and service providers at fifth place. All the verticals grew well at double-digit percentages in 2021. 
 
Shifting to annual sector revenue for the year in 2021. Cloud Titans registered approximately 30% of the revenue, enterprise and financials came in at approximately 40%, and the providers at approximately 30%. Microsoft was the only greater than 10% customer at a 15% contribution. We do expect Meta, formerly Facebook, to become our second 10% revenue customer in 2022, as we improve lead time.&quot;

3 big catalysts that vacanza drive to the moon AEMETIS‚ÄôS price

1) Tension in East Europe between Russia/Ukraine. If Russia invaded, price of oil goes +$100 and Aemetis margins can go definitely up since there is a positive correlation with oil;

2) 28th February Credit Suisse Conference and updated of the 5 year plan
Last year the, at CS conference, the CEO Eric Mc Afee has been definitely brilliant and after that conference the price doubled/tripled in a short period. I guess that we can have a violent uptrend due to the update of 5 year plan ans SAF/biodiesel contracted spoken in the CS conference. New institutional funds will buy shares;

3) Beat of estimate for IVQ results,
I give it as almost sure since the strong positive margins that ethanol has experienced at end 2021

Consumers walked away from about 1.5mn video on-demand accounts such as Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus and Now during the first three months of the year, according to figures from analytics group Kantar. 
 
Britbox, Apple TV Plus and Discovery Plus had the highest churn rate ‚Äî meaning they lost the most users on a gross basis. 
 
Netflix and Amazon‚Äôs Prime Video had the lowest churn rates in the quarter. Kantar said this was a sign they were ‚Äúthe last to go when households are forced to prioritise‚Äù.

Quanta, the world&#39;s biggest contract notebook manufacturer and a MacBook maker.
Tesla has shuttered its Shanghai Giga factory, which produced about 2,000 electric cars a day.

Incoming cargo is now stuck at Shanghai marine terminals for an average of eight days before it&#39;s transported elsewhere, a 75% increase since the recent round of lockdowns began.
Cargo airlines have canceled all flights in and out of the city, and more than 90% of trucks supporting import and export deliveries are currently out of action.

Big bear hier ...Wall Street might think harmless; hmm, what are those things, berries, in his hand? 
What am I saying. I want the hand #FOOD

 Consumer weakening, inflation is strengthening, peak inflation is not here yet and I think big CPI beat so will be worse than last report, by a lot. 9.2% is my guess. Definitely, 8.5% min., which is bad enough to cause panic of 0.50% rate hike next FOMC May 4th, make it a 95% probability. But, 9% makes it a, sudden, 50% probability of FED needing to hike 0.75% next FOMC.
So, can consumer stay strong enough to push inflation to 15% by summer, I think they can. At that point, things really go downhill, so, no, inflation is too heavy weight on equities to do anything but de-growth it, to answer your question @PurpleReign8 
And, as consumer pushes harder, as tech falls from less interest too--Chase analyst just said phone &amp; PC sales waning interest-- they will lose more &#39;n more, until exhausted by Fall, broke-n.

But, back to your statement of Apple vs PC, so to speak.

 Both companies are in serious trouble now, made BAD INVESTMENTS.
 Microsoft overpaid $50 Billion,  company they&#39;ll be lucky to get 2 billion REV from per YEAR. Call of Duty, Clashe, Candy Crush stale.

And Apple has invested way too much into a dream car that&#39;s just that,  a dream, plus EV space gets very crowded quickly with Ford, Rivian, Milan, Lucid, etc.. etc.

7293,448215344," The Pentagon said on Tuesday that it would delay its long-awaited Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability contract, or JWCC, to December. 
 
The comments, from the Pentagon&#39;s Chief Information Officer, were first reported by Reuters, and could impact companies such as Microsoft ($MSFT), Amazon ($AMZN), Google ($GOOG) and Oracle ($ORCL). 
 
These tech giants have long vied for the valuable contract, which could be worth as much as $10 billion over five years. 
 
The contract had initially been expected to be awarded next month. 
 
In April 2021, a judge declined to toss Amazon&#39;s objections to Microsoft winning the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, contract, after Amazon claimed in court filings former President Donald Trump &quot;screwed&quot; it out of the contract. 
 
In July 2021, the deal between Microsoft (MSFT) and the Pentagon was put on hold as the JEDI contract was canceled and would be replaced with the JWCC.

Parker pointed out that the potential of a new GTA release in 2023 is likely to continue to drive momentum in the stock. And KeyBanc looked back at history to see how it performed in prior cycles and offered several insights.

‚ÄúThe stock clearly outperformed on larger news days teasing or confirming GTA V in the lead-up to launch. The cumulative analysis from reveal to launch actually shows underperformance during the period, but it‚Äôs heavily influenced by a broader video games sector selloff in 2011/2012. If we attempt to adjust for the selloff, which we would argue has already happened coincidentally this time around, the year prior to launch saw TTWO stock move +53% relative to the Nasdaq at +12% over the same period,‚Äù wrote Parker in a research note.

The act, which still needs other approvals, seeks to prevent tech giants from dominating digital markets, with the threat of whopping fines or even the possibility of a company breakup. 
 
For instance, US tech co.s face tighter restrictions on using people‚Äôs data for targeted online ads while different messaging services or social media platforms would be required to work together. 
 
EU reached a preliminary agreement with the US that paves the way for Europeans‚Äô personal data to be stored in the US. 
 
EU also has another set of rules, the Digital Services Act, that aim to ensure online safety for users through stricter requirements to flag and remove harmful or illegal content or services like hate speech and counterfeit goods.

With a suite of ETFs it plans to create, Direxion Funds aims to give investors a chance to make leveraged bets on, and bearish bets against, some of the biggest household names on Wall Street. The firm plans to provide leveraged and inverse ETFs for individuals who are either bullish or bearish on mega-cap stocks, like Meta Platforms ($FB), Apple ($AAPL), Amazon ($AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), Alphabet ($GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft ($MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). 
 
Direxion has filed a prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for 21 exchange traded funds that will allow investors to take either a -1X, -2X, or +2X approach on each of the mega-cap names above.

8903,434620619," Microsoft ($MSFT) may acquire cybersecurity company Mandiant ($MNDT), Bloomberg reported. 
Though no deal is finalized, according to a source familiar with the discussions, Microsoft may look to acquire the cybersecurity-research company to bolster its products and help protect customers from hacks and breaches. 
 
Mandiant and Microsoft did not immediately return requests for comment from Seeking Alpha. 
 
Last year, FireEye was rebranded as Mandiant and now has a market value of approximately $3.7 billion and would be the Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#39;s second deal in a month, after it announced its intention to acquire video game maker Activision (NASDAQ:ATVI) in January for nearly $69 billion.

The meeting, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, took place the week before January 14 and was included Kotick and Alexander von Furstenberg, the stepson of media mogul Barry Diller and the son of his wife, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. 
 
The three men bought call options on Activision (ATVI) for $40, when shares were trading at roughly $63, meaning the options were in the money. 
 
Just days later, Microsoft (MSFT) agreed to buy Activision (ATVI) for $95 per share in cash, paying almost $69 billion. 
 
 
It was previously reported that the three men spent approximately $108 million on the options, and have an unrealized profit of roughly $60 million.

My Game Plan sent out Sunday morning focused on preparing for the coming earnings season and getting positioned in what I believe will be the winners and trying to avoid the losers. GOOGL is one name I wrote about as a stock I really like into earnings.

Tonight I&#39;m sending out a blog to members titled &quot;The Three Little Pigs&quot;, where I break down three different tiers of tech/growth stocks, over 20 names. 

Which are in the brick house (strongest)  heading into earnings, and which reside in the other two houses.

- Goods inflation has been low for two decades prior to the pandemic due to efficient supply chain and continuous cost improvements 
- Service inflation has been traditionally the main driver of inflation in Canada 
- The pandemic upend that balance. Unable to spend on services such as gym and travel due to lockdown, people spent their money on goods, just as global supply chains were disrupted 
- Reopening will shift that balance toward its traditional mix. Plus supply chain easing will cool down goods inflation too.

Analyst Dan Ives noted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are likely to be &quot;pressured into M&amp;A&quot; and continue to add to their cloud platforms, with Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS), Tenable (NYSE:TEN), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD), SailPoint (NYSE:SAIL) and Ping (NYSE:PING) as potential acquisition candidates. 
 
&quot;In a massive growth backdrop for cyber security and further tailwinds seen during this Ukraine invasion from Russia bad actors/nation state attacks, we believe today&#39;s deal is the tip of the iceberg ...&quot; 
 
&quot;In a nutshell this deal was a shot across the bow from Google to Microsoft and Amazon with this flagship cyber security acquisition of Mandiant.&quot;

White pointed out that Google Cloud has seen &quot;rapid growth&quot; in recent years, most recently growing revenue 45% year-over-year in its most recent to $5.54 billion, with total 2021 revenue at $19.2 billion.  
 
According to industry researcher Canalys, Amazon&#39;s AWS generated $53.5 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, account for 33% of the market. Microsoft (MSFT) had an estimated 22%, while Google was well behind them at 9%.Other cloud providers, including IBM (IBM) accounted for 36% of the overall cloud infrastructure market. 
 
On Wednesday, Boeing (BA) tapped Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), as well as Microsoft (MSFT), and (AMZN) for a cloud computing deal that some believe may be worth more than $1 billion.",2022-04-10T01:38:20Z,NONE
10639,451187564," White said that BigLake was the most &quot;significant&quot; announcement of the event, as it will expand on Google BigQuery and extend the cloud data warehouse on top of data lakes in a multi-cloud environment. BigQuery competes with the likes of Snowflake, AWS&#39;s Redshift and Azure&#39;s Snynapse, with Google describing it as a ‚Äúa data lake storage engine, to remove data limits by unifying data lakes and warehouses.&quot; 
 
Essentially, it lets companies unify data warehouses and lakes to analyze their data without worrying about a storage format change or system upheaval. 
 
Another innovation of note was the Spanner change stream, which is expected to launch this quarter, White said. This is Google&#39;s relational database that is capable of performing more than 2 billion requests per second at its peak. 
 
the new stream has a number of numbers, including having the &quot;freshest data as they can easily replicate changes from Spanner to BigQuery for real-time analytics.‚Äù

White noted that a number of innovations were unveiled at the summit, all of which had the objective to allow ‚Äúcustomers to work with limitless data, across all workloads, and extend access to everyone.‚Äù 
 
Innovations like BigLake, Spanner change streams, Vertex AI Workbench, Vertex AI Model Registry and Connected Sheets for Looker were all deemed impressive, with White calling them &quot;key,&quot; especially BigLake.

The company reported quarterly sales of $2.57 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $2.41 billion by 6.60 percent. This is a 89.59 percent increase over sales of $1.35 billion the same period last year.

LinkedIn recently started testing a no-politics setting. It filters out content about political parties and candidates, election outcomes, ballot initiatives and more. The company has made the setting available to some U.S. users over the past few months. 
 
&quot;We‚Äôre seeing a lot of Gen Z join the network right now,&quot; Mr. Roslansky told me, adding that job moves are up nearly 70% for users ages 16 to 22, vs. just 7% for users over 55. &quot;We‚Äôre seeing the platform evolve much more to cater to them.&quot;

SO.... Now the Swiss Cheese.  What can we give him that he feels like he got something, but is full of holes?  Maybe promise him no warheads from NATO in Ukraine for 20 years that can travel more than 10 miles.  Or  no nuclear weapons in Ukraine ever.  Something we don&#39;t care about but he can brag he got something.  We have other weapons and other ways to launch than from Ukraine.

Microsoft to Reportedly Acquire Mandiant to Bolster Security Products
Microsoft is reportedly planning to acquire a US-based cyber security company Mandiant. According to a new report from Bloomberg, this new acquisition will help the Redmond giant to beef up its portfolio of security offerings to protect its customers from cybersecurity threats and data breaches.

For those unfamiliar, Mandiant is a cybersecurity research firm that was founded back in 2004. With over 5000 employees currently working at Mandiant, the company helps organizations and government customers to identify and protect themselves from high-profile cyber security threats and reduce security costs. It specializes in various services such as network security, computer forensics, incident response, threat intelligence, as well as endpoint protection.

In a statement obtained by the FT, Microsoft (MSFT) President Brad Smith admitted some of the claims were &quot;valid,&quot; but not all of them. 
 
‚ÄúWhile not all of these claims are valid, some of them are, and we‚Äôll absolutely make changes soon to address them,‚Äù Smith said, adding that the company is ‚Äúcommitted to listening to our customers and meeting the needs of European cloud providers‚Äù. 
 
The European Union has reportedly sent a questionnaire to Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) rivals asking about the terms for using Microsoft&#39;s software and if they are at a disadvantage. 
 
On Monday, investment bank UBS said Microsoft (MSFT) was at risk of seeing a &quot;gentle deceleration&quot; in Office 365-related growth as benefits from the pandemic and work-from-home boom are starting to fade.

Microsoft, which has largely escaped the scrutiny from lawmakers around the world that has been placed on some of the other large tech companies may soon find itself in hot water for some business practices relating to its cloud computing unit, Azure. 
 
According to the Financial Times, Microsoft could face an informal antitrust review in Europe over the fact that it is reportedly using certain anti-competitive practices to obtain customers and usher them away from competitors such as Amazon&#39;s ($AMZN) Web Services and Google ($GOOG) ($GOOGL) Cloud. 
 
Microsoft is reportedly tying in Windows and Office to help grow Azure, which critics argue is a similar business practice that brought the last antitrust case against the company in the early 2000s.

11960,437013006," Zynga ($ZNGA) could see an extended FTC antitrust review of its planned $12.7B sale to Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO). 
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission may look at pursuing &quot;creative approaches&quot; to the antitrust review, which could lead to a longer timeline, according to a CTFN report, which cited a source. Take-Two is said to be confident that it&#39;s on path to get all necessary regulatory approvals. 
 
The Zynga deal seemed to usher in a spate of deals in the video game sector including Microsoft&#39;s ($MSFT) planned almost $70B purchase of Activision ($ATVI) and Sony&#39;s ($SONY) deal to acquire &#39;Halo&#39;/&#39;Destiny&#39; developer Bungie in $3.6B deal. 
Take-Two management is said to believe that a review might be easier than others in the gaming industry since its focused on the crowded mobile gaming space rather than console games or virtual reality, according to the CTFN report.

My thoughts on today&#39;s selloff .... 

I&#39;m noticing the &quot;experts&quot; are talking a lot about GARP (growth at a reasonable price) lately. Including Cramer himself tonight. Last May, 11 months ago I featured a blog for members (SEE BELOW) on this very topic, and how these overvalued growth stocks would come crashing back to earth. And now everyone wants to play &quot;Monday morning quarterback&quot; after all the damage that will never be undone in most these names. 

460/462 was the level I had targeted for members as the level I was getting  short again, and I have stuck with my belief that we have been experiencing a bear mkt rally. I am still short the mkt, but have been bullish on commodities especially fertilizer names. The trend to me is lower overall, but I caution those who think we see a crash. I don&#39;t. 

We are going to be setting up for a short term technical bounce this week. I have my shopping list ready. However, it will only be for a trade. ‚úåÔ∏è",2022-04-12T00:04:01Z,NONE

As such, he lowered the estimates for Office 365 revenue growth to 17.4% from 19.1% for Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) fiscal 2023. 
 
Keirstead also lowered estimates for Windows, due to a potential risk of slowing PC growth and in Server Product and LinkedIn due to tough comparisons.

Microsoft shares tumbled on Monday after investment bank UBS said the tech giant could start to see a &quot;gentle deceleration&quot; in Office 365-related growth. 
 
Analyst Karl Keirstead, who rates Microsoft buy with a $360 price target, noted that Office 365 is the company&#39;s second-largest product, behind Azure and likely generated $35.1 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue, growing at between 19% and 21% quarter-over-quarter for the last six quarters. 
 
But given that it likely has &quot;high penetration&quot; and benefits from the pandemic and work-from-home boom are starting to fade, Office 365 growth could start to slow. 
 
Keirstead added that Microsoft remains the dominant franchise in the employee productivity software market, with the race between it and Google ($GOOG) ($GOOGL) &quot;effectively over&quot; and is now trying to displace Microsoft Azure by making Google Cloud more competitive.",2022-04-11T22:21:52Z,NONE

The company has released a game in the lucrative series annually each year since 2005. 
 
A new CoD is still set to be released this fall, but the move means that 2023 will be the first time in nearly 20 years that the franchise will skip a release. 
 
The decision comes as Microsoft ($MSFT) prepares its takeover of the videogame publishing giant - and is likely to give a fresh look at the annual development schedule.

Gross margins for all companies are roughly equivalent in the 60-75% range, as expected by a SaaS business model.

The only metric that makes Snowflake look moderately fair is book value, they&#39;ve raised significantly more in cash and assets than the others. Then you see their FCF, margins, and sales multiple before throwing up.

DataDog is almost equal to Etsy in trailing growth and gross margins, but 7x more expensive by sales and 10x by FCF with negative operating margins. Etsy is actually cheaper than MSFT in some metrics.

A side note, the situation in Ukraine is far more tense than people realize because the issue isn&#39;t about America fighting Russia, but rather Ukrainian military starting skirmishes directly with Russian military armed by the US which would be a spark in dry tinder. The conflict would escalate very fast. But, these recent market sell offs have little to do with Russia as it is with the US economic data which was on average far worse than expected, Fed rate hikes and tapering.

The final two growth drivers are LinkedIn, which Microsoft ($MSFT) bought in 2016, and Dynamics. Weiss said that since Microsoft (MSFT) acquired LinkedIn, its revenue has nearly tripled, as the business-focused social network has grown in B2B advertising, hiring, training and learning and more. 
 
Dynamics is likely to help Microsoft (MSFT) address changes in the business environment, by expanding its portfolio of applications. Though it only accounted for 2.3% of Microsoft&#39;s 2021 revenue, it could grow in the mid-20% range in the near term, Weiss said. 
 
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3817493-microsoft-has-several-ways-to-get-to-20-in-earnings-power-by-2026-ms-says",2022-03-27T17:34:20Z,NONE
12441,447498641," Outside of these two areas, the biggest contributors to Microsoft ($MSFT) earnings reaching $20 a share are likely to be Dynamics, LinkedIn, gaming and security. 
 
Security, ever-present in a world where cyberattacks are increasing due to geopolitical issues, is also an important factor for Microsoft (MSFT). Security has helped generate $15 billion in related revenue for Microsoft (MSFT) over the past 12 months, and it&#39;s likely that this will grow as threats remains high and the company sees gains from enterprise spending Weiss said, according to a previous survey. 
 
Gaming is also likely to be a strong driver for earnings, the pending Activision ($ATVI) acquisition notwithstanding. 
 
Weiss noted that with Microsoft&#39;s (MSFT) strength in the cloud, it is in a strong position to improve content and expand its community, which should position gaming as a strong revenue generator for Microsoft in the long term.",2022-03-27T17:34:02Z,NONE
12442,447498573," With the size of the total addressable market [TAM] for public cloud in the hundreds of billions of dollars, combined with multi-year deals, momentum and secular growth trends, it&#39;s likely that Azure can help boost Microsoft&#39;s earnings considerably. 
 
Weiss added that a shift towards faster growing and &quot;more durable&quot; consumption can help Azure sustain growth, continue to be the leader in the hybrid cloud, and grow its market share along with its platform-as-a-service, existing relationships and wide array of distribution 
 
For Office 365 it&#39;s about rising prices, but also the ability to add more tools and give customers a value benefits such as the continued enhancements made to Teams, Power Business Intelligence and Power Apps, and increased security. 
 
 
It also comes down to growing seat licenses, including getting front-line workers access; he that total Commercial Office revenue, which includes the non-Office 365 version of Office, could reach $60B in 2026.

The real-world reasons for buying Big Tech are few and far between as people are leaving tech , even, wanting TO WORK OVER PLAYING GAMES ON PHONE OR CONSOLE , GAMING.
It is obvious in the #s, 3.9% unemployment rate, near full employment in the USA....

This is all I&#39;m saying, OH, and, a real profit to the metaverse needs built out with soo much, and, is YEARS from a material value to markets.

Facebook less and less engagement is a microcosm example of tech with stake offerings, which goes beyond the stuff of chit-chat on FB, spanning to gaming and mobile gameplay as well....

We are THROUGH with current growth cycle for tech; all this preaching you have been hearing me do and scoffing at me is now real-ly understood.

Tech is dying, Covid killed the desire &amp; growth now dying from technological hiatus til, at least, 2024, as meta, VR, gets built out .

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). 8-10% of its revenues come from video gaming directly, with Xbox being one of the largest brands. Strong secular tailwinds for the gaming space. The potential merger with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) would add ~$9B of gaming revenue for Microsoft.

Corporate Vice President, Customer Security &amp; Trust Tom Burt said the group, known as Strontium that it has &quot;tracked for years,&quot; was trying to take control of seven internet domains to coordinate the attacks. 
 
Microsoft obtained a court order to take control of the domains &quot;to mitigate Strontium‚Äôs current use of these domains and enable victim notifications,&quot; It has seized control of more than 100 Strontium controlled domains, getting court orders 15 different times. 
 
 
In addition to going after organizations in Ukraine, Strontium, which Microsoft called a &quot;Russian GRU-connected actor,&quot; was also targeting government institutions and think tanks in the U.S. and European Union. 
 
Strontium is also known as Fancy Bear or APT28 and is often linked to Russian intelligence.

So Buffett took a $1 billion stake in Activision mere weeks before Microsoft acquired it? Despite no position in any other gaming stocks like Take-Two or Roblox or EA? 

Could this have possibly been any more obvious? Will the SEC actually do something or the investigation seems too difficult here? üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Warren Buffett took $1B stake in Activision Blizzard before Microsoft deal 

Famed investor Warren Buffett&#39;s firm, Berkshire Hathaway, acquired shares of video game giant Activision Blizzard worth nearly $1 billion during the fourth quarter ‚Äì weeks before Microsoft bought the company for $68.7 billion.

The recent stock surge means Buffett‚Äôs firm is already set up for a tidy on-paper profit worth approximately $975 million at the time of Berkshire Hathaway&#39;s 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The timing of the acquisition could raise eyebrows given Buffett‚Äôs decades-long friendship with Bill Gates&quot;.

Possible upsides: 
1. SYNERGY: Connexity acquisition seems to have been a good decision. Let&#39;s wait for tech and product to introduce synergy into the overall offering of the company. Such integrations take time. 
2. ACQUISITIONS?: Relationship with $MSFT still strong. Contract until mid 2024. Other long-term contracts with big names. With the absurdly low valuation of the company right now (barely $2B !), I would be surprised if there aren&#39;t several M&amp;A teams sniffing around. 
3. PUBLICITY: IMO company didn&#39;t get a chance to enjoy the spotlights just yet. Let&#39;s wait for a large analyst firm to begin coverage? I wonder, though, how come a company that does PR for a living doesn&#39;t enjoy a great PR. Is it by choice? Or maybe they&#39;ve only ever mastered algorithmic and technological PR, but are ignorant as hell when it comes to real-life PR (marketing).

&quot;We anticipate potential acquirers might be hesitant to pursue a deal considering [Ubisoft&#39;s] history of defending acquisition attempts from EA and Vivendi,&quot; the analyst explained. &quot;Further, we think Ubisoft has cultural challenges related to sexual misconduct that have ripped through the organization and led to leadership departures. We are cautious on UBI‚Äôs migration away from owned IP, with licensing deals including Avatar and Star Wars.&quot; 
 
Ubisoft, which trades as an ADR, saw its shares close on Friday at $10.31. 
 
 
The firm also added that it is &quot;cautiously constructive&quot; on longer-term growth opportunities, including free-to-play and mobile games from a number of Ubisoft&#39;s franchises, including Assassin‚Äôs Creed, Avatar, Far Cry, Star Wars, Beyond Good &amp; Evil and more.

Mike Hickey raised his rating to hold from sell, with the firm focusing on more encouraging growth opportunities in 2023 and 2024, even though some &quot;linger concerns over execution risk have been somewhat realized.&quot; 
 
In addition, Hickey said that while the firm isn&#39;t confident that Ubisoft will be acquired, it could happen, &quot;given current consolidation trends and mismanagement.&quot; 
 
&quot;We think recent deals including Take-Two ($TTWO)- Zynga ($ZNGA) and Microsoft ($MSFT)- Activision ($ATVI) has provided a valuation floor for UBI,&quot; Hicker wrote in a note to clients. &quot;We imagine an acquirer would bid an approximate ‚Ç¨65 for UBI (up 45%), which would be in-line with MSFT‚Äôs consideration of ATVI on a profit multiple.&quot;",2022-02-23T03:00:43Z,NONE

Ives contended that getting through &quot;white-knuckle&quot; market environments like those caused by the Ukraine invasion involves finding winners and defensive names within the tech sector. 
 
 Ives pointed to areas like cybersecurity, which he thinks will receive a long-term tailwind from increased international tensions. He mentioned Zscaler (NASDAQ:$ZS) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:$PANW) as potential buying opportunities.",2022-02-24T15:34:52Z,NONE

13380,442866112,"$NVDA $TSLA $AMZN $MSFT as much of many of us want to jump in with both feet with what seems like a rally forming, one has to recognize that 80% of yesterdays gains happened premarket with the regular session proving a slight rise to sideways movement. These aren‚Äôt the signs of a rally with legs. 

But overall, the rise was based on two things. Hope for productive talks this evening between Russia and Ukraine.  And the consolidation of oil prices. Prices that will do little if anything to change rising gas prices and have any meaningful impact on consumer behavior which is already evolving as we speak. 

Smart money traders are smart and holding back on any conviction moves at this moment. The key is to stay nimble at this moment in time. 

Several big traders have their eyes on Square primarily as a momentum trade. If Thursday sees continued up movement, it may be a stock for a swing movement to 130. If we see a down day, be ready to see 75% of the market liquidate.

On a 68-31 vote, the Senate passed the 2,700-page, $1.5 trillion omnibus containing all 12 fiscal 2022 spending bills, $13.6 billion in supplemental appropriations to address the crisis in Ukraine and a lengthy list of unrelated measures fortunate enough to ride on the must-pass vehicle.  
 
As Republicans sought, the omnibus allows for almost equal increases in defense and nondefense spending from last year‚Äôs levels, with a $46 billion or 6.7 percent boost for nondefense programs and a $42 billion, 5.6 percent increase in defense accounts. Democrats had sought roughly double that amount for nondefense programs.

As part of the announcement, Chris Capossela, Microsoft Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, said the offices would start to open on February 28. From then, employees would have 30 days to adjust their routines and adopt their schedules after they&#39;ve been agreed upon by their managers. 
 
&quot;Reaching this stage allows us to fully open our facilities to employees, visitors and guests. All campus services will return, including the Connector ride-share option for employees in the Puget Sound area,&quot; Capossela wrote in the blog post. &quot;Additionally, we‚Äôre pleased to be joining other area businesses welcoming back more employees in the coming weeks.&quot;

The S&amp;P 500 (SP500) ($SPY) is trading right around a technical level that would support a bottoming in process for U.S. equities, FS Insight says. 
 
The S&amp;P (SP500) +1.6% needs to move above 4,365 for the rally to extend, Mark Newton, head of technical strategy, wrote in a note. It is currently trading at 4,359. 
 
The Nasdaq 100 ETF ($QQQ) +0.7% needs to move above $342 and it is now trading at $343. 
 
When &quot;prices remain under prior days‚Äô highs amidst a negative trend with bearish momentum, I favor being long and buying dips, anticipating that markets work higher into March FOMC, and that Growth outperforms Value,&quot; Newton said.
