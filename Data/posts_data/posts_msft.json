Allen suggested the name, which was short for micro-computer software. \n  \nThe pair\u2019s initial work was to program the Altair 8800 microcomputer. They then began developing operating systems, getting a contract from IBM for its personal computer in 1980. Five years later, the company introduced Microsoft Windows, which became the dominant operating system for personal computers to this day.  \n  \nThe success of Microsoft made both Gates and Allen multi-billionaires, and Gates held the title of world\u2019s richest person for several years before he began giving his fortune away.

It&#39;s Fed control. Bonds keep climbing, home builder confidence falls stocks aren&#39;t phased. This is the bubble the Fed created with their moronic QE and 0%. They&#39;ve inflated the largest bubble in US history. Infinite QE, buying corporate bonds, lead to historic stock buy backs. Now? Their hands are tied. If they do nothing and keep rates at 0.1% and pumping QE, inflation will  turn into hyper-inflation. If they raise, it&#39;ll throw the US into recession and they&#39;ll prick their own bubble.
