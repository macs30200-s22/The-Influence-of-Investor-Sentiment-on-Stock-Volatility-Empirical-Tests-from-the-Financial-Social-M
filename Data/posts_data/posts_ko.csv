Thankfully you won&#39;t gotta go far to find it. Investor relations has it all. What can it teach you? Stock splits, divvy hikes, and oh the power of compounding in conjunction with both. History teaches us this: Last split was when the divvy was 0.51 x 4 and the price per share was 78. Come the 60th hike that divvy will be edging ever closer to 0.51. The price per share is already at 60-62ish. Why should you care? This will explain it: 100 shares today, split you&#39;d get 200 with each share forking out 0.21 x 4 (0.42/2). The price per share would get cut in half (30ish). Now your being given a chance to bag more on the cheap. So you&#39;ve got 200 shares, you bag another 100 @ 30ish.

I do not believe there will be a full scale war in ukraine since china does not back up a possible russian move in ukraine.

The european union need to support ukraine more and the US should stay out of it.

Even the ukranian president said that the panic shout outs by Biden is not really helpful.

Hunter Biden was working for a ukranian gas company 3 months after the revolution (2014) and that the CIA director John Brennan were there too were not helpful. And now 90 tons of ammunition? That is not deescaltion.

Putin was right that the NATO is not only a selfdefence union (example: operation allied force in serbia was illegal) . BUT he does not have the right to break the souveranity of a foreign country.

The ukranians need to fulfill the minsk agreement as soon as possible (since 2014) , the NATO need to backoff from the east european countries and russia need to pull back from their borders.",2022-02-21T13:58:27Z,NONE

You said it well! 

Now, with POYYF, personally I&#39;m probably going to stick with them long term BECAUSE at the end of the day what do we all need? We need a stable flow of cash to meet expenses. 

How do we get that? 

1. Sell shares ( can only do this so long) 

2. Sell covered calls ( risky and not all stocks have options)

3. Live off dividends. 

I look at the yield on cost for POYYF and it seems like such a slam dunk. Highly Profitable gold mine, loves to reward their shares holders, gold prices will remain up.....so where else can I find a repeatable Yield on Cost ( Or repeating ROI) of basically 46%? 

91 cent annual dividend / $2 = 45.5% YOC. 

Now is the dividend guaranteed? Of course not. Even if they slashed it in half its still a 23% YOC! 

Oh let me go buy some boring $KO with it&#39;s 2% dividend NOT! üòÇ

Analysts criticized him for paying &quot;high&quot; price based on then P/E ratio. Back then Coke had &quot;recipe&quot; to make the drink  and had good distribution net work in &quot;developed&quot; world. WB saw the net work going into &quot;developing&quot; nations world wide. So he believed that at 25-30x earning it was a bargain because the cost of making the drink was low and it would have been lower in those developing countries. 
BB owns QNX IP that is now in almost 200 million cars worldwide and just signed on 24/25 or 82% of &quot;future&quot; cars or EV. Those &quot;future&quot; cars are not counted in our today&#39;s earning because it&#39;s in the future, just like Coke in developing countries.
